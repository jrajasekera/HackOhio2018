      "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Thursday claimed he would sign an executive order \"next week\" aimed at restricting US asylum rules, as he seeks to use a group of Central American migrants heading for the US border as part of his midterm election closing argument.\nHe also suggested that the US troops he dispatched to the US-Mexico border could fire on someone in the migrant caravan if the person threw rocks or stones at them. In a meandering speech at the White House about immigration, Trump recycled many of the talking points he touts on the campaign trail -- but offered little in the way of concrete ways to address the problems he embellished. Trump said his administration is finalizing an executive action that would limit asylum claims to legal ports of entry, claiming migrants frequently abuse the system by fabricating their need for asylum. But he declined to specify how a change he described as a forthcoming executive order would work, or why he was convening a presidential address for a policy shift that is still in the preliminary stages. Read More Asked if he envisions US troops firing on anyone in the groups of migrants, Trump told reporters at the White House: \"I hope not. I hope not -- but it's the military.\" Trump shocks with racist new ad days before midterms \"I hope there won't be that,\" Trump said, but added that anybody throwing rocks or stones at the military service members will be considered to be using a firearm, \"because there's not much difference when you get hit in the face with a rock.\" Pentagon regulations only justify deadly force in face of threat A US defense official told CNN that the troops deployed to the border will be operating under the standard rules on the use of force and will only use such force in self-defense. Official Department of Defense regulations say \"deadly force is justified only when there is a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm to a person.\" Lt. Col. Jamie Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said following Trump's remarks that the Defense Department \"will not discuss hypothetical situations or specific measures within our rules on the use of force, but our forces are trained professionals who always have the inherent right of self-defense.\" \"I would also emphasize that our forces are in support of DHS/CBP, who are performing law enforcement activities,\" Davis said. Defense officials have repeatedly emphasized the troops at the border are there to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. The top general overseeing US Northern Command said on Tuesday that \"CBP (Customs and Border Protection) personnel are ... absolutely the primary and principal members that will be handling, specifically, the migrants.\" \"There could be incidental interaction between our military members and migrants or other personnel that might be in that area. And so we are making that our soldiers, our Marines are going to be fully trained in how to do that interaction,\" Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy said. The general added, \"They're going to understand the rules for that interaction, and they'll be consistent with CBP.\" Remarks come ahead of midterms Trump has focused increasingly on immigration heading into the final days of the midterms , as Republicans across the country struggle to match their opponents in drumming up voter enthusiasm. Trump did not release details on the asylum proposal or how it would be implemented, saying only that he intended to sign an order sometime next week restricting asylum claims. With three campaign rallies, a midterm election and a trip to France on the books, however, the President's schedule for next week is already crowded. The President said he would sign an immigration-related executive order next week, but was not specific as to what it would address. A White House aide had said earlier Thursday that Trump would unveil an executive action requiring migrants to request asylum at legal points of entry and preventing them from claiming asylum if they are caught crossing the border illegally. Although the President referenced such a policy in his speech, he offered no defense of how such a plan, once finalized, could be legal, given laws presently allowing migrants the right to claim asylum once they are on American soil. The Trump administration has been looking at ways to limit the number of asylum seekers, with the President and his allies often describing asylum as a \"loophole.\" The Immigration and Nationality Act says that anyone who arrives in the US \"whether or not at a designated port of arrival\" may apply for asylum if he or she has a \"well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\" Earlier this year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said victims of gang and domestic violence no longer qualify for asylum. \"Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even all serious problems, that people face every day all over the world,\" he said in June. As attorney general, Sessions has broad power over asylum procedures and the immigration courts, which are under the auspices of the Justice Department. Legal fight looms as Trump admin considers caravan order that could violate federal law He has also suggested that those claims should be rejected even before asylum seekers appear before a judge and begin court proceedings and that the simple fact of crossing the border illegally could also be a factor in rejecting an asylum claim. CNN reported earlier this week that the administration is also considering a plan to limit the number of migrants able to enter at legal ports of entry by \"metering,\" essentially creating a waitlist to allow people to enter only if the Department of Homeland Security has the capacity to process and detain them at one of its facilities, a department official said. In the past, the practice of metering has resulted in individuals deciding not to endure a lengthy wait to try to get into the country legally and instead to cross illegally. Should some of this group of migrants do the latter, they could face a tougher and higher standard for seeking asylum under the administration's plans. White House aides had considered having Trump deliver an immigration speech earlier in the week, but the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre on Saturday delayed those plans.",

      "text": "(CNN) As the 2018 midterm election nears, President Donald Trump is disseminating false and misleading statements at a pace that leaves even his own past prevarications in the dust.\nIn the month of October, Trump said 1,104 things that were totally or partially untrue -- more than double his next most prodigious month (September), according to the tireless cataloging by The Washington Post's Fact Checker blog . THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\nTrump is averaging -- AVERAGING -- 30 false or misleading claims a day in the last seven weeks. And, per the Fact Checker, he often of late soars far above that average. As one example: On October 22, when he traveled to Houston to hold a rally for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R), Trump, said 83 untrue things in a single day. 83! The scope of Trump's falsehoods is literally breathtaking. In the 649 days between his inauguration and October 30, Trump has made 6,420 claims that are partially or entirely false. That includes a number of assertions -- that the Russia probe being overseen by special counsel Robert Mueller is a hoax, that the Trump tax cut was the biggest in history -- that Trump has repeated ad infinitum. He's said the Russia investigation is a hoax or a witch hunt 157 times and claimed his was the biggest tax cut ever 120 times, according to the Fact-Checker .) (Sidebar: Many people ask why I don't simply refer to Trump's falsehoods as lies. Two reasons in this case: 1) The Post tabulates false or misleading claims and so, when quoting their numbers, I prefer to use their wording for accuracy and 2) As I've explained before , I think we can, and should, call out a lie when we either know or have a reasonable expectation that Trump is aware that something he's saying is false.) Read More The sheer number of Trump's deceptions pushes back on his claim to ABC News' Jon Karl that \"I do try ... and I always want to tell the truth.\" The record suggests otherwise. Facts are, for Trump, fungible things. When they fit his narrative, he is happy to tout them. But they rarely fit his narrative. And when they don't, he has zero concern about creating his own narrative that simply doesn't have any real resemblance to the established truth. In fact, as the Fact Checker's numbers make clear, Trump seems to flaunt his fact-less claims -- assuring his supporters that he is telling the \"real\" truth that the media won't let them in on. Trump has turned that tendency toward untruthfulness into a political strategy; he is so politically incorrect that he doesn't even abide by the rules of fact and truth that the so-called \"elites\" think he should. It's truly stunning -- and frightening -- stuff. What's more terrifying to me is that Trump's supporters don't seem to know -- or care -- about any of this. They regard fact checks by the media as simply the \"fake news\" doing everything they can to slow down Trump's momentum. And to the extent they acknowledge that Trump doesn't tell the truth a lot of the time, they write it off as either a) him just talking or b) that all politicians lie. (Most politicians do say untrue things from time to time. When called on them, however, they stop saying the false things. Trump is not like that.) Trump also works aggressively to ensure that his base sees him as the only honest man in the country, the only person who is really telling it like it is. \"Stick with us,\" he told a VFW crowd in Kansas City back in July. \"Don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. ... What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening.\" Here's the thing, though: It is happening. Facts are not a partisan position. And here's one fact no one should forget: Donald Trump is misleading -- and outright lying at times -- at a pace that we have never seen before in politics. Never.",

      "text": "Trump says up to 15,000 troops may be sent to the border Border Patrol Union president Brandon Judd on preparations for the arrival of migrant caravans from Central America. The number of U.S. troops deployed to the Mexico border in response to the approach of a caravan containing an estimated 4,000 Central American migrants could go as high as 15,000, President Trump said Wednesday afternoon. Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that “we’ll go up to anywhere between 10 and 15,000 military personnel on top of Border Patrol, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) and everybody else at the border.”\nHowever, the Pentagon also said Wednesday afternoon that its initial estimate was for 7,000 troops at the border.\nA deployment of 15,000 would bring the military commitment on the border to roughly the same level as in war-torn Afghanistan. Video\nTrump rejected the idea he was “fearmongering,” or using the issue for political purposes.\nHe said the move would be aimed at preventing the entry of the caravan, which is still nearly 1,000 miles from the border.\nTrump said that the U.S. was “going to be prepared,” and that the migrants are “not coming into our country.”\nThe White House repeatedly has warned members of the caravan that they will not be allowed into the United States. In an interview on Fox News’\"The Ingraham Angle\" Monday night, Trump vowed that the migrants “are not coming in,” and said the administration would build “tent cities” to house asylum-seekers.\nThe forces are largely providing airlift transportation, tents, barriers and other logistical support for the Border Patrol.

      "text": "Washington (CNN) A federal judge on Friday denied President Donald Trump's appeal to pause discovery in a lawsuit that alleges he violated a constitutional clause banning gifts and advantages from foreign and domestic governments, raising the possibility that transactions between the Trump International Hotel and foreign dignitaries might be made public.\nTrump's legal team had sought to delay turning over documents while it appeals a decision to allow other portions of the lawsuit to proceed. However, Friday's ruling, issued by US District Judge Peter Messitte, now clears the path for discovery to move forward on business dealings between the Trump Hotel and foreign dignitaries. The case was brought by the governments of Washington, DC, and Maryland and argues the President has failed to comply with the emoluments clause through the Trump International Hotel. WASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 10: The Trump International Hotel is shown on August 10, 2017 in Washington, DC. The hotel, located blocks from the White House, has become both a tourist attraction in the nation's capital and also a symbol of President Trump's intermingling of business and politics. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) Maryland and DC have said the Trump International Hotel's operations put other nearby hotels and entertainment properties at a competitive disadvantage, and that the Trump hotel got special tax concessions for the hotel, which won its lease on a federally owned property before Trump's election. \"Accordingly, the President's ownership interest in the Trump International Hotel and his apparent receipt of benefits from at least some foreign and state governments, as well as from the Federal Government itself, suggest that he has received 'emoluments' in violation of the Constitution, giving rise to plausible causes of action against him brought by parties with standing,\" Friday's opinion read. Read More A lawyer for the Trump Organization declined to comment. The White House did not immediately return CNN's request for comment. Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh released a statement on Friday saying that the decision \"affirms once again that Maryland and the District of Columbia have standing to sue, with the court emphasizing that the President's proposed definition of the term emolument is 'exceedingly strained' and would prohibit only 'what is tantamount to a bribe.' \" \"We agree with the court that the President's motion was nothing more than an attempt to delay the ultimate resolution of our lawsuit, a tactic that the court said 'as a matter of justice, cannot be countenanced,' \" the statement continued. DC Attorney General Karl Racine also released a statement Friday about the ruling: \"This is another major win for us in this historic case. Our next step is to proceed with discovery. We will soon provide the court a new schedule to begin the process of getting information about how President Trump is profiting from the presidency.\" In July , Messitte ruled against the Trump legal team's request to dismiss parts of the lawsuit, and largely sided with Maryland and DC's definition of emolument as an \"advantage.\" Messitte's July ruling offered the term \"emolument\" as essentially banning the President from receiving \"anything more than de minimis profit, gain, or advantage\" in his private capacity, which he echoed in Friday's opinion and referenced the Foreign Clause and the Domestic Clause in the US Constitution.",

      "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump, whose time in office has been defined in large part by his frequent falsehoods and misleading statements, claimed Wednesday he tries to be truthful.\n\"I remember, you remember well in the campaign, you made a promise. You said, 'I will never lie to you,'\" ABC News' Jon Karl said to Trump in a new interview. \"So can you tell me now, honestly, have you kept that promise at all times? Have you always been truthful?\" \"Well I try. I mean, I do try. I think you try, too. You say things about me that are not necessarily correct,\" Trump replied. \"I do try, and I always want to tell the truth. When I can, I tell the truth.\" \"I mean sometimes it turns out to be where something happens that's different or there's a change. But I always like to be truthful,\" he added. Trump's comments are especially notable coming at the close of a contentious campaign season in which he has repeatedly engaged in smears and falsehoods to advance Republican electoral fortunes, from inflating his rally crowd sizes to accusing Democrats, frequently without evidence, of supporting ruinous immigration policies. Read More Last week, former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, a strong supporter of the President, said Trump \"is a liar\" and that he \"should probably dial down the lying.\" \"OK, well we both know that he's telling lies. So if you want me to say he's a liar, I'm happy to say he's a liar,\" Scaramucci told CNN's John Berman on \"New Day.\" Last week, CNN tracked Trump's most-repeated claims and found that the President is most accurate during prepared remarks and when touting his strong economic record. But he strays from the truth when improvising with reporters or attacking his opponents, and some of the claims he made simply aren't supported by any evidence at all, the report found.",

      "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Thursday claimed he would sign an executive order \"next week\" aimed at restricting US asylum rules, as he seeks to use a group of Central American migrants heading for the US border as part of his midterm election closing argument.\nHe also suggested that the US troops he dispatched to the US-Mexico border could fire on someone in the migrant caravan if the person threw rocks or stones at them. In a meandering speech at the White House about immigration, Trump recycled many of the talking points he touts on the campaign trail -- but offered little in the way of concrete ways to address the problems he embellished. Trump said his administration is finalizing an executive action that would limit asylum claims to legal ports of entry, claiming migrants frequently abuse the system by fabricating their need for asylum. But he declined to specify how a change he described as a forthcoming executive order would work, or why he was convening a presidential address for a policy shift that is still in the preliminary stages. Read More Asked if he envisions US troops firing on anyone in the groups of migrants, Trump told reporters at the White House: \"I hope not. I hope not -- but it's the military.\" Trump shocks with racist new ad days before midterms \"I hope there won't be that,\" Trump said, but added that anybody throwing rocks or stones at the military service members will be considered to be using a firearm, \"because there's not much difference when you get hit in the face with a rock.\" Pentagon regulations only justify deadly force in face of threat A US defense official told CNN that the troops deployed to the border will be operating under the standard rules on the use of force and will only use such force in self-defense. Official Department of Defense regulations say \"deadly force is justified only when there is a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm to a person.\" Lt. Col. Jamie Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said following Trump's remarks that the Defense Department \"will not discuss hypothetical situations or specific measures within our rules on the use of force, but our forces are trained professionals who always have the inherent right of self-defense.\" \"I would also emphasize that our forces are in support of DHS/CBP, who are performing law enforcement activities,\" Davis said. Defense officials have repeatedly emphasized the troops at the border are there to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. The top general overseeing US Northern Command said on Tuesday that \"CBP (Customs and Border Protection) personnel are ... absolutely the primary and principal members that will be handling, specifically, the migrants.\" \"There could be incidental interaction between our military members and migrants or other personnel that might be in that area. And so we are making that our soldiers, our Marines are going to be fully trained in how to do that interaction,\" Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy said. The general added, \"They're going to understand the rules for that interaction, and they'll be consistent with CBP.\" Remarks come ahead of midterms Trump has focused increasingly on immigration heading into the final days of the midterms , as Republicans across the country struggle to match their opponents in drumming up voter enthusiasm. Trump did not release details on the asylum proposal or how it would be implemented, saying only that he intended to sign an order sometime next week restricting asylum claims. With three campaign rallies, a midterm election and a trip to France on the books, however, the President's schedule for next week is already crowded. The President said he would sign an immigration-related executive order next week, but was not specific as to what it would address. A White House aide had said earlier Thursday that Trump would unveil an executive action requiring migrants to request asylum at legal points of entry and preventing them from claiming asylum if they are caught crossing the border illegally. Although the President referenced such a policy in his speech, he offered no defense of how such a plan, once finalized, could be legal, given laws presently allowing migrants the right to claim asylum once they are on American soil. The Trump administration has been looking at ways to limit the number of asylum seekers, with the President and his allies often describing asylum as a \"loophole.\" The Immigration and Nationality Act says that anyone who arrives in the US \"whether or not at a designated port of arrival\" may apply for asylum if he or she has a \"well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\" Earlier this year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said victims of gang and domestic violence no longer qualify for asylum. \"Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even all serious problems, that people face every day all over the world,\" he said in June. As attorney general, Sessions has broad power over asylum procedures and the immigration courts, which are under the auspices of the Justice Department. Legal fight looms as Trump admin considers caravan order that could violate federal law He has also suggested that those claims should be rejected even before asylum seekers appear before a judge and begin court proceedings and that the simple fact of crossing the border illegally could also be a factor in rejecting an asylum claim. CNN reported earlier this week that the administration is also considering a plan to limit the number of migrants able to enter at legal ports of entry by \"metering,\" essentially creating a waitlist to allow people to enter only if the Department of Homeland Security has the capacity to process and detain them at one of its facilities, a department official said. In the past, the practice of metering has resulted in individuals deciding not to endure a lengthy wait to try to get into the country legally and instead to cross illegally. Should some of this group of migrants do the latter, they could face a tougher and higher standard for seeking asylum under the administration's plans. White House aides had considered having Trump deliver an immigration speech earlier in the week, but the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre on Saturday delayed those plans.",

      "text": "Politics Published 16 hours ago Last Update 13 hours ago Trump announces plan to deny asylum-seekers who don't show up at ports of entry, in latest major immigration policy shift By Gregg Re | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video President Trump: Our immigration laws are incompetent President Trump addresses illegal immigration and border security.\nPresident Trump announced in a lengthy speech at the White House on Thursday afternoon that, in response to what he called the \"crisis at our southern border\" and a surge of fraudulent asylum claims in recent years, his administration will soon require asylum-seekers to \"lawfully present themselves\" at a port of entry.\nThe move appeared designed to prevent many members of the leading Central American migrant caravan -- which now numbers approximately 4,000, down from a high of 7,200 -- from making asylum claims if and when they reach the U.S. border. Asylum claims made by migrants caught crossing the border illegally would seemingly be summarily denied under Trump&apos;s proposal.\nThe asylum clause of the Immigration and Nationality Act says that anyone who arrives to the U.S. may apply for asylum based on a well-founded fear of persecution, and Trump&apos;s decision was likely to prompt immediate federal court challenges.\nIn his remarks, Trump called the thousands of migrants in the approaching caravans from Central America \"not legitimate asylum-seekers\" because most of them have not decided to remain in Mexico and pursue asylum there. \"Asylum is not a program for people living in poverty,\" he said.\nThe president also issued something of a warning to members of the caravan, including those who reportedly threw rocks at members of the Mexican police this week.\n\"We will consider that a firearm,\" Trump said. \"We will consider that the maximum we can consider that, because they&apos;re throwing rocks viciously and violently. .... We&apos;re not going to put up with that. They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I told them to consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks, like they did at the Mexico military and police, I said, consider it a rifle.\"\nAsked by a reporter to clarify if U.S. troops might fire on the caravan, Trump responded, \"I hope not, I hope not -- but it&apos;s the military.\"\n\"They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back.\"\n— President Trump The president&apos;s statement marked his latest major policy pronouncement on illegal immigration with just days to go before the Nov. 6 midterm elections, following his decision to send thousands of troops to the U.S. border and his push to end birthright citizenship , which he said could be accomplished by executive order.\nTrump said Thursday he would issue a \"comprehensive\" executive order next week on immigration matters, including his asylum plan.\n\"If these caravans are allowed into our country, only bigger and more emboldened caravans will follow -- and you see that&apos;s what&apos;s happening now,\" Trump said.\nSESSIONS SAYS &apos;VAST MAJORITY&apos; OF ASYLUM CLAIMS ARE INVALID, ANNOUNCES NEW RULES TO CUT DOWN ON ASYLUM CLAIMS\nIn a statement, Omar Jadwat, the director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, condemned the president&apos;s announcement.\n\"If he plans at some point to prohibit people from applying for asylum between the ports of entry, that plan is illegal,\" Jadwat said. \"What is clear from the timing and vague nature of today’s remarks is that he is simply trying to inflame his base in the final run-up to the midterms.”\nTrump and other administration officials have long encouraged those seeking asylum to come through legal ports of entry. However, many migrants may be unaware of that guidance, and official border crossings have grown increasingly clogged.\nImmigration officials have turned away asylum-seekers at ports of entry citing overcrowding, telling them to return at a later date. Backlogs have grown especially bad in recent months at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas, with people typically waiting five weeks to claim asylum at San Diego&apos;s main crossing and sleeping out in the open for days at a time.\nA woman holding her baby hitches a ride on the fender of a tanker in Niltepec, Mexico, on Tuesday. (AP)\nMigrants who cross illegally are generally arrested and often seek asylum or some other form of protection. Claims have spiked since 2010, and there is currently a backlog of more than 800,000 cases pending in immigration court.\nDetention facilities are also nearly at their maximum capacity; Trump on Thursday said more are being constructed, and that illegal immigrants will be held in \"massive cities of tents.\"\nAdministration officials have railed against what they say are loopholes designed to encourage people, especially from Central America, to come to the U.S. and claim asylum. On Thursday, Trump said human trafficking -- in which \"the lowest scum on Earth ... steal children\" -- has hit unprecedented levels, in part because of lax asylum policies.\n\"We will not allow our generosity to be abused by those who would break our laws, defy our rules, violate our borders, break into our country illegally -- we won&apos;t allow it,\" Trump said. \"Mass uncontrolled immigration is especially unfair to the many wonderful law-abiding immigrants already living here, who followed the rules and waited their turn.\"\nOnce illegal immigrants apply for asylum, even if their claims are fraudulent, they previously have been allowed into the U.S. pending the adjudication of their asylum claims -- which require a credible fear of imminent persecution based on a limited number of factors, such as political or religious belief, in order to be upheld.\nVideo Most asylum claims often fail to meet this high legal standard after they are reviewed by aslyum judges, and only about 20 percent of applicants are approved.\n\"They never show up at the trials,\" Trump said, referring to people who claim asylum and then are released into the country. \"They never come back, they&apos;re never seen again.\"\nASYLUM CLAIMS OVERWHELM U.S. SYSTEM -- A LOOK AT THE NUMBERS\nThe president also emphasized that children were separated from their parents at the border under President Obama&apos;s administration -- although those separations occured with less frequency than they did under the Trump administration&apos;s zero-tolerance policy, which dramatically ramped up the criminal prosecutions for illegal border crossers that had legally necessitated the separations. Trump has since signed an executive order to keep parents and children together after they&apos;re caught illegally crossing the border.\nTrump&apos;s comments came hours after the leading caravan trying to make its way to the U.S. border failed in its efforts to convince the Mexican government to offer dozens of buses to speed up their journey northward.\nOn Thursday, Trump again characterized the caravan as an \"invasion\" that has \"overrun the Mexican police -- and hurt, badly, Mexican soldiers. ... They&apos;re wasting their time. They should turn back now.\"\nThe caravan initially totaled more than 7,000 people, but its numbers have dwindled as thousands have either applied for asylum in Mexico or returned to Honduras.\nA second, smaller group of 1,000 or so migrants is more than 200 miles back. A third band of about 500 from El Salvador has made it to Guatemala, and a fourth group of about 700 set out from the Salvadoran capital Wednesday.\nAt a rally Wednesday in Fort Myers, Fla., Trump charged that the leading incoming caravan represents a security threat. \"They got a lot of rough people in those caravans -- they are not angels. They are not,\" he said.\nVideo Trump has said that up to 15,000 U.S. troops could be deployed to the border if the caravan continues its approach. The Pentagon noted Wednesday afternoon that its initial estimate was for 7,000 troops at the border.\nThe president also has sparred with some in his own party, including outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., over Trump&apos;s proposal to end birthright citizenship, which allows children of illegal immigrants to automatically become U.S. citizens if born within the country&apos;s borders.\n\"Illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" Trump said to applause at Wednesday&apos;s rally, to chants of \"U-S-A!\"\nThat comment was significant because the 14th Amendment reads: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\"\nTED CRUZ: BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP &apos;INCENTIVIZES&apos; ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, NEEDS TO GO\nSome Republicans are advancing the theory that illegal immigrants are not \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the U.S. within the meaning of that provision, which would give Congress the legal daylight to pass a law codifying Trump&apos;s view, modifying the current Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA) of 1952 and ending birthright citizenship.\nWhile an 1898 Supreme Court case appears contrary to that view , the issue has not been tested in the courts in modern times, and Republicans are newly emboldened by the 5-4 conservative majority on the Supreme Court.\nStill, Trump&apos;s suggestion that he could legally bypass Congress and simply issue a unilateral executive order to enact his proposed change was \"obviously\" incorrect, Ryan said this week.\nThat prompted Trump to fire back on Twitter and charge that Ryan \"knows nothing about the issue.\" The president also said Ryan should \"focus on holding the Majority\" -- a nod to polls showing that Republicans face tough odds to retain control of the House after the Nov. 6 midterm elections.\nTrump also followed up with a clip of a 1993 speech from former Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, in which he claimed that \"no sane country\" would have birthright citizenship. Reid reversed his position in 1999, under pressure from union groups.\nFox News&apos; Greg Norman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\nGregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

      "text": "Washington (CNN) Michael Cohen claimed that President Donald Trump used racist language in several private conversations with him during the time he worked as Trump's personal lawyer and \"fixer.\"\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair that published Friday, Cohen recalled four times that Trump made denigrating comments to him about black people. CNN has confirmed from a source close to Cohen that the Vanity Fair story and quotes are accurate. The White House did not respond to Vanity Fair's multiple requests for comment. CNN has also reached out to the White House for comment. Cohen alleged that Trump made a disparaging comment about African-American voters when they were discussing the turnout for one of his 2016 campaign rallies. \"I told Trump that the rally looked vanilla on television. Trump responded, 'That's because black people are too stupid to vote for me,' \" the President's former lawyer told the magazine. Read More Cohen claimed that when South African leader Nelson Mandela died, Trump remarked, \"'Name one country run by a black person that's not a s***hole,' and then he added, 'Name one city.'\" He said that when he and Trump were traveling to Chicago in the late 2000s, \"we were going from the airport to the hotel, and we drove through what looked like a rougher neighborhood.\" \"Trump made a comment to me, saying that only the blacks could live like this,\" Cohen told Vanity Fair. Cohen also claimed that Trump said \"there's no way'\" he could let an African-American contestant from season one of \"The Apprentice\" be the reality show's winner. According to Vanity Fair, Cohen expressed regret over not quitting his job at the Trump Organization after Trump allegedly made those remarks to him, telling the magazine, \"I should have been a bigger person, and I should have left.\" The latest allegations from Cohen against his former boss come after their relationship soured over a federal investigation into Cohen. Cohen pleaded guilty in August to eight criminal counts of tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations. He also said that \"in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office\" -- referring to Trump -- he had helped keep potentially harmful information about Trump from becoming public during the 2016 campaign. Cohen is scheduled to be sentenced in December. Former White House communications staffer Omarosa Manigault Newman, who was fired from her job last December, claimed in her book \"Unhinged\" that Trump had used a racial slur on the set of \"The Apprentice.\" Trump has denied Manigault Newman's claim and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has said Manigault Newman's book is \"riddled with lies and false accusations.\"",

      "title": "Michael Cohen claims Trump made repeated racist references - CNNPolitics",
      "text": "Washington (CNN) Michael Cohen claimed that President Donald Trump used racist language in several private conversations with him during the time he worked as Trump's personal lawyer and \"fixer.\"\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair that published Friday, Cohen recalled four times that Trump made denigrating comments to him about black people. CNN has confirmed from a source close to Cohen that the Vanity Fair story and Quote: : s are accurate. The White House did not respond to Vanity Fair's multiple requests for comment. CNN has also reached out to the White House for comment. Cohen alleged that Trump made a disparaging comment about African-American voters when they were discussing the turnout for one of his 2016 campaign rallies. \"I told Trump that the rally looked vanilla on television. Trump responded, 'That's because black people are too stupid to vote for me,' \" the President's former lawyer told the magazine. Read More Cohen claimed that when South African leader Nelson Mandela died, Trump remarked, \"'Name one country run by a black person that's not a s***hole,' and then he added, 'Name one city.'\" He said that when he and Trump were traveling to Chicago in the late 2000s, \"we were going from the airport to the hotel, and we drove through what looked like a rougher neighborhood.\" \"Trump made a comment to me, saying that only the blacks could live like this,\" Cohen told Vanity Fair. Cohen also claimed that Trump said \"there's no way'\" he could let an African-American contestant from season one of \"The Apprentice\" be the reality show's winner. According to Vanity Fair, Cohen expressed regret over not quitting his job at the Trump Organization after Trump allegedly made those remarks to him, telling the magazine, \"I should have been a bigger person, and I should have left.\" The latest allegations from Cohen against his former boss come after their relationship soured over a federal investigation into Cohen. Cohen pleaded guilty in August to eight criminal counts of tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations. He also said that \"in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office\" -- referring to Trump -- he had helped keep potentially harmful information about Trump from becoming public during the 2016 campaign. Cohen is scheduled to be sentenced in December. Former White House communications staffer Omarosa Manigault Newman, who was fired from her job last December, claimed in her book \"Unhinged\" that Trump had used a racial slur on the set of \"The Apprentice.\" Trump has denied Manigault Newman's claim and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has said Manigault Newman's book is \"riddled with lies and false accusations.\" ",

      "title": "Roger Stone reveals he talked to Trump campaign about WikiLeaks in 2016 - CNNPolitics",
      "text": "(CNN) Roger Stone was in communication with at least one senior Trump campaign official about upcoming WikiLeaks disclosures during the 2016 presidential race, Stone revealed Thursday.\nIn an opinion piece for the right-wing Daily Caller, Stone published an exchange he had with Steve Bannon, then the chief executive of the Trump campaign. The emails are among the documents in special counsel Robert Mueller's possession as he investigates whether Stone had an inside-track with WikiLeaks and whether he shared any of that information with then-candidate Trump or Trump's inner circle. \"What was that this morning???\" Bannon wrote to Stone on October 4, 2016. Earlier that day, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had delivered a speech billed as an \"October surprise\" announcement and had promised additional Clinton-related leaks. But the event turned out to be a publicity stunt where Assange touted his organization's 10th anniversary. All Assange offered was another promise of more materials before the election, angering some Trump supporters who were hoping for a bombshell. Roger Stone beefs up his legal team Stone replied to Bannon that Assange didn't release any documents out of security concerns. Then Stone wrote, \"However -- a load every week going forward.\" In his column Thursday, Stone said this particular prediction was based on publicly available information. Read More \"More importantly my prediction of 'a load every week going forward' is based on Assange's own public announcement hours before-that there would be weekly releases going through and beyond the election and not any communication with Wikileaks or Assange,\" Stone wrote in his piece headlined \"The Treachery of Steve Bannon.\" Steve Bannon interviewed by Mueller's team for at least the third time While Stone says he still hasn't been contacted by the special counsel, nearly a dozen of his associates have been contacted for interviews with Mueller's team or testimony before the grand jury. Last week, Mueller's team interviewed Bannon for a third time, including about his communications with Stone. Stone's move to publish the emails pre-empted a New York Times story Thursday about Stone's efforts to pitch himself to Trump campaign officials as a WikiLeaks insider. At least one campaign official told investigators that Stone told campaign officials he had ties to Assange, according to a person familiar with the investigation. Stone made a variety of pronouncements during the 2016 campaign suggesting he had ties to Assange or advance knowledge about what WikiLeaks was planning to release. The timing of the email exchange between Stone and Bannon could also be of interest to investigators. Days later, on October 7, 2016, WikiLeaks unveiled the hacked emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. It was convenient timing for the Trump campaign. It came about 30 minutes after one of the most damaging moments of Trump's presidential campaign: when a recording became public showing Trump bragging about grabbing women's genitals in previously unaired footage from a 2005 interview with 'Access Hollywood.' Mueller drills down on Roger Stone's WikiLeaks contacts While Stone made a show -- publicly and privately -- of bragging about his close ties to Assange during the 2016 campaign, he has since revised his story. Stone said he relied on publicly available information, tips from journalists and a backchannel source -- progressive New York activist and radio host Randy Credico. Credico, who has been interviewed multiple times by investigators and testified before the grand jury, has denied that he acted as Stone's backchannel. It remains unclear what charges Stone could face, if any. In a separate email published by The New York Times, Stone encourages Bannon to have Trump campaign surrogates tout a story -- without any evidence -- that Bill Clinton has a love child. Roger Stone aide hopes Kavanaugh will support his case against Mueller Then he asks Bannon to have GOP donor Rebekah Mercer fund his efforts to spread the Clinton story. \"I've raise (sic) $150K for the targeted black digital campaign thru a C-4,\" Stone wrote. \"Tell Rebecca to send us some $$$.\" The request could run afoul of federal election law. On Thursday, Stone told CNN he never received any money from the Mercers.",

      "text": "(CNN) President Donald Trump lamented on Thursday that last week's two domestic terror incidents had stopped Republican momentum ahead of the midterm elections.\nTrump said the pipe bombs mailed to prominent Democratic politicians and CNN and the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue had taken attention away from the Republican campaign to hold on to control of Congress during the midterms. \"We did have two maniacs stop a momentum that was incredible, because for seven days nobody talked about the elections,\" he said during his closing remarks at a Missouri rally. \"It stopped a tremendous momentum.\" Trump acknowledged the human cost of the package bombs and the shooting. \"More importantly, we have to take care of our people, and we don't care about momentum when it comes to a disgrace like just happened to our country,\" he added. \"But it did nevertheless stop a certain momentum, and now the momentum is picking up.\" Read More Trump's remarks echoed his tweet last Friday lamenting the \"news not talking politics.\" \"Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this 'Bomb' stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows - news not talking politics,\" he tweeted . \"Very unfortunate, what is going on. Republicans, go out and vote!\" Trump also called Tuesday's elections \"very important\" during the rally Thursday. \"These are the midterms. Nobody thought of the midterms as being that big a deal for years. For years, nobody thought of the midterms. You know, you hear midterms, it's like 'let's go to sleep,' right?\" he said. Trump noted that this year's turnout is \"breaking every single record,\" which he called a \"beautiful thing.\" A CNN poll last month projected a tight Senate race in Missouri, with incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill garnering 43% of the vote and Republican candidate Josh Hawley garnering 42%.",

      "text": "Donald Trump didn't tell the truth 83 times in 1 day Analysis by Chris Cillizza, CNN Editor-at-large Updated 10:50 AM EDT, Fri November 02, 2018\n(CNN) As the 2018 midterm election nears, President Donald Trump is disseminating false and misleading statements at a pace that leaves even his own past prevarications in the dust.\nIn the month of October, Trump said 1,104 things that were totally or partially untrue -- more than double his next most prodigious month (September), according to the tireless cataloging by The Washington Post's Fact Checker blog . View this interactive content on CNN.com\nTrump is averaging -- AVERAGING -- 30 false or misleading claims a day in the last seven weeks. And, per the Fact Checker, he often of late soars far above that average. As one example: On October 22, when he traveled to Houston to hold a rally for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R), Trump, said 83 untrue things in a single day. 83!\nThe scope of Trump's falsehoods is literally breathtaking. In the 649 days between his inauguration and October 30, Trump has made 6,420 claims that are partially or entirely false. That includes a number of assertions -- that the Russia probe being overseen by special counsel Robert Mueller is a hoax, that the Trump tax cut was the biggest in history -- that Trump has repeated ad infinitum. He's said the Russia investigation is a hoax or a witch hunt 157 times and claimed his was the biggest tax cut ever 120 times, according to the Fact-Checker .)\n(Sidebar: Many people ask why I don't simply refer to Trump's falsehoods as lies. Two reasons in this case: 1) The Post tabulates false or misleading claims and so, when quoting their numbers, I prefer to use their wording for accuracy and 2) As I've explained before , I think we can, and should, call out a lie when we either know or have a reasonable expectation that Trump is aware that something he's saying is false.)\nThe sheer number of Trump's deceptions pushes back on his claim to ABC News' Jon Karl that \"I do try ... and I always want to tell the truth.\" The record suggests otherwise.\nFacts are, for Trump, fungible things. When they fit his narrative, he is happy to tout them. But they rarely fit his narrative. And when they don't, he has zero concern about creating his own narrative that simply doesn't have any real resemblance to the established truth.\nIn fact, as the Fact Checker's numbers make clear, Trump seems to flaunt his fact-less claims -- assuring his supporters that he is telling the \"real\" truth that the media won't let them in on. Trump has turned that tendency toward untruthfulness into a political strategy; he is so politically incorrect that he doesn't even abide by the rules of fact and truth that the so-called \"elites\" think he should.\nIt's truly stunning -- and frightening -- stuff. What's more terrifying to me is that Trump's supporters don't seem to know -- or care -- about any of this. They regard fact checks by the media as simply the \"fake news\" doing everything they can to slow down Trump's momentum. And to the extent they acknowledge that Trump doesn't tell the truth a lot of the time, they write it off as either a) him just talking or b) that all politicians lie. (Most politicians do say untrue things from time to time. When called on them, however, they stop saying the false things. Trump is not like that.)\nTrump also works aggressively to ensure that his base sees him as the only honest man in the country, the only person who is really telling it like it is.\n\"Stick with us,\" he told a VFW crowd in Kansas City back in July. \"Don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. ... What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening.\"\nHere's the thing, though: It is happening. Facts are not a partisan position. And here's one fact no one should forget: Donald Trump is misleading -- and outright lying at times -- at a pace that we have never seen before in politics. Never. ",

      "text": "Santa Clarita, California (CNN) Donald Trump's presidency has sparked revolt among large swaths of young Americans.\nBut as Election Day draws near, a question looms: Will they vote? Typical midterm elections tend to draw out an older, whiter electorate and fewer single women than presidential years. But because of the deep disdain for Trump among the younger generation, this midterm cycle appears supercharged by younger voters who were stung by the outcome in 2016, and cognizant that their generation could have made the difference for Hillary Clinton. Strong turnout within that age group could tip some of the closer House races into the Democratic column. There's \"an embarrassment that comes with having not voted, or having not cared about voting in the past,\" said Jessica Cohen, a 30-year-old product manager for a software company in California. Read More \"(People) are realizing how many consequences there have been since 2016,\" she added. \"That apathy has gotten us into some serious trouble.\" New polling this week confirms that the energy among youth voters on the ground isn't a mirage. A new poll from Harvard Institute of Politics this week found that 18-to-29-year-olds are far more likely to vote in Tuesday's midterm election than they were in 2010 and 2014. Forty percent of those polled said they would \"definitely vote\" in the midterms. President Trump's job approval rating among those under 30 was 26%. If he runs for re-election in 2020, 59% of those polled said they \"will never\" vote for him. In one striking finding, 65% of likely voters in the 18-to-29 age group said they were more fearful than hopeful about the future. Immigration and refugees topped the list of concerns, followed by jobs, President Trump (or leadership issues), and health care. A record 800,000 people registered to vote in a single day The energy among the younger generation has also resulted in a crop of candidates in their late 20s and early 30s. One of those candidates is 31-year-old Katie Hill, the Democrat running in California's 25th District against incumbent Republican Rep. Steve Knight. Clinton won this district in 2016. Hill is one of the youngest Congressional candidates running this November, along with Abby Finkenauer in Iowa's First District, and Lauren Underwood in Illinois's 14th District. Every weekend morning in recent months, dozens of young voters have shown up at Hill's campaign headquarters in Santa Clarita. The office is wedged in a strip mall between a gun armory and a vape shop, underscoring the political diversity of this partly-suburban, partly-rural district north of Los Angeles. The line of canvassers spilling out the door is decidedly youthful: Echo Park hipsters, Berniacs sporting 2020 T-Shirts, athletic young moms pushing jogging strollers, and large contingents of USC and UCLA students who are competing over who can make the most voter contacts in California's competitive House districts. Hill, a first-time candidate who filmed one of her campaign commercials while free-climbing a hundred-foot rock wall in nearby Texas Canyon, blends in easily in her purple campaign T-shirt and aqua skinny jeans. But she steps up on the staircase to rally this fresh crop of doorknockers, warning that national Republican groups are pouring last-minute money into the race because it is polling within the margin of error. \"You can tell people when you're knocking on those doors that this election could come down to a few hundred votes,\" Hill tells the group as they ready the lists on their clipboards. \"So their vote really will matter more in this election than probably any election that they'll ever vote in - and that there's no path to flipping the House and holding Donald Trump accountable or making any real progress across the country if we don't flip this seat.\" At Hill's headquarters, 30-year-old Caitlin Carlson said she was relieved that people in her generation finally \"want to step up and do something.\" \"We have been coasting a little bit. We just always kind of assumed that things would work out,\" Carlson said. \"Taking the House back is the first step to getting our country back on the rails. It just feels like we're on this crazy train right now where logic and facts don't matter.\" She views Tuesday's election as \"the first real big test for millennials to have faith that the system works.\" There's a big push in 2018 to get young people to register to vote Nationally, Democrats have engaged in a forceful effort this fall to convince younger voters that flipping control of the US House could serve as a check on Trump administration policies that they don't agree with. They have enlisted many of the potential 2020 Democratic candidates -- including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris -- to deliver that message. On Friday night in Oceanside, Sanders drew hundreds of cheering, foot-stomping young fans to a rally organized by California Young Democrats for down ballot candidates, including Mike Levin, the Democrat who is vying for the open seat of retiring Republican Congressman Darrell Issa in Orange and San Diego counties. Levin, an environmental attorney, delivered an even more pointed message than Sanders -- telling the crowd that the 2018 midterm election will be \"won or lost\" by people between the ages of 18 and 35. \"In 2016, 31 million voters in that age group, all very much eligible to vote, decided not to,\" Levin told the rally crowd gathered in a gymnasium. \"The result was Donald Trump -- and Charlottesville, and a tax cut designed to benefit the wealthiest 1% of Americans, and Justice Neil Gorsuch, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\" (Kavanaugh's name alone drew the loudest boos of the night). \"You stay home on Election Day, and Republicans stay in charge,\" Levin continued. \"Your healthcare gets taken away, your student loans become more impossible to pay off, and places like Pulse (the nightclub in Orlando) and Parkland are joined by many more preventable tragedies.\" Christina Ruiz, a 31-year-old in the crowd who came to see Sanders, said she had just sent in her ballot - the first she has ever cast in a midterm election. \"My friends are way more involved in voting now,\" said Ruiz, a single mom who tutors at MiraCosta College where the rally was being held. \"Even in the midterms. I never really remember them posting about them, and now they're on Facebook every day talking about it.\" When Ruiz thinks about Democrats retaking the House, she said she hopes they will advance Sanders' agenda for universal health care and free college tuition. \"That's still a pipe dream, but it's something that we're moving towards,\" Ruiz said. She also believes divided government could force more compromise and bring more unity to America. \"Right now there's so much polarization going on. I feel it; I feel it even at school.... Before people were always Democrats or Republicans or something else, but you didn't have that hatred. Now it's like you're afraid to talk about politics, even with people in your own family.\" Perhaps no one has more faith in the power of the youth vote this cycle than Hill herself. The former head of a non-profit that was focused on the region's homeless crisis, Hill often reminds her audiences that she never expected to fill this role -- but decided she needed to step up if her perspective was going to be heard. \"We have to turn out young people, and I believe that we can this time,\" Hill said in an interview. \"I had so many people tell me that's a losing strategy, and I just don't believe that's true. This is a campaign, and this is a moment in history, when people are going to show up.\" Correction: This story has been updated to correctly attribute quotes to Christina Ruiz.",

      "text": "Washington (CNN) When the Trump administration first asked the Pentagon to send troops to the southern border, the administration wanted the troops to take on duties that Department of Defense officials viewed as law enforcement functions, CNN has learned.\nThe Pentagon said no. According to two defense official familiar with the request, the Department of Homeland Security asked that the Pentagon provide a reserve force that could be called upon to provide \"crowd and traffic control\" and safeguard Customs and Border Protection personnel at the border to counter a group of Central American migrants walking to the US border to request asylum. Nigerian army appears to use Trump's words to defend shooting of protesters The Pentagon rejected the request on October 26, according to one of the officials, even as it signed off on providing DHS with air and logistics support, medical personnel and engineers. The request was turned down because the Department of Defense felt that active duty troops do not have the authority to conduct that type of mission unless they are granted additional authorities by the President. Read More Defense officials have repeatedly emphasized the troops at the border are there to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. Despite multiple defense officials characterizing those activities as relating to law enforcement actions, a DHS official disagreed that such functions constituted law enforcement. \"While DHS has discussed the need for potential assistance with force protection of CBP personnel, calling this line of support 'law enforcement activities' would be factually inaccurate,\" the DHS official said. 'Quickly and for a long time' Active duty US troops are barred from domestic law enforcement unless there is an emergency, but President Donald Trump has repeatedly raised the prospect of having troops enforce the border as he campaigns hard on the dangers of immigration in the final days before the midterm elections. At a White House speech on Thursday, the President suggested that troops should fire on migrants if they throw rocks, saying that rocks should be considered rifles and comparing the group of about 3,000 men, women and children to an \"invasion.\" On Friday, Trump tried to walk back those comments, telling reporters that \"if our soldiers,\" or Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers \"are going to be hit in the face with rocks, we're going to arrest those people. That doesn't mean shoot them. But we're going to arrest those people quickly and for a long time.\" The defense officials described the force DHS requested as something that would only be used if CPB personnel were overwhelmed by the situation on the border. Even so, the Pentagon rejected the request for the reserve \"protection\" force, while it simultaneously approved all of DHS' other requests for support with Secretary of Defense James Mattis' approval. It's not clear if Mattis weighed in on the decision to reject the request for troops to perform law enforcement functions. Despite rhetoric, illness threat from migrants is minimal, experts say The first defense official said that in its response to DHS, the Defense Department said that if Homeland Security officials still want the reserve force of US troops, they should ask the White House to formally grant the Pentagon the authorities to perform those additional functions. Customs and Border Protection declined to comment. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, speaking to Fox News last week, said DHS had asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support, as well as vehicle barriers and \"ways in which we can protect my officers and agents, as well as the ports of entry themselves.\" The Posse Comitatus law forbids the US military from enforcing domestic laws, unless there's no other choice. Military analysts say Trump can easily use the National Guard, US Marshals or personnel from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to back up border officers if need be. Costs of the operation More than 8,000 active duty troops could be deployed troops to the southwest border, more than he has serving in some of the world's most contentious combat zones, but they are there solely to support Homeland Security officials as they prepare for the migrants' arrival. The troops will join over 2,000 National Guardsmen who are already at the border, meaning upwards of 10,000 American forces will be mobilized to stop Central American migrants that are still some hundreds of miles away from the border and weeks away from arriving in the US Senior military officers have defended the deployment on national security grounds, but the mission -- dubbed Operation Faithful Patriot -- has been met with scathing criticism from many former military officials. Retired Gen. Martin Dempsey, who served as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2011 to 2015, tweeted Friday that \"our men and women in uniform are better trained, better equipped, and better led so they meet any threat with confidence. A wasteful deployment of over-stretched soldiers and Marines would be made much worse if they use force disproportional to the threat they face. They won't.\" The Pentagon has yet to determine the cost of the operation, nor has it identified the account where the funding would come from. But the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments estimates that the cost of placing active duty troops on the border could range from $42 million 110 million. JUST WATCHED Trump: Up to 15,000 troops going to the border Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nTrump: Up to 15,000 troops going to the border 01:56 CSBA says that on the high end, the deployment would cost $143 per troop per day for operating and maintenance costs and $112 per troop per day on the low end. CSBA also estimates that the use of military aircraft in this deployment would cost about $136,645 per day. With the mission currently set for November 5 through December 15, for a total of 41 days, the cost of deploying 8,000 troops and air support ranges from approximately $42 million to $55 million, according to the CSBA estimate. Trump has said the total number of troops could climb as high as 15,000 , which CSBA calculates the price tag to be at approximately $90 million to $110 million. On Thursday, Trump claimed the military is putting up thousands of tents to hold migrants, but officials said there are no plans as of now to build tents. The officials said that while there had been informal talks between the Department of Defense and DHS about having the military build tent facilities to house detained migrants, tents were never part of the formal request for assistance submitted by DHS and approved by Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. One official says that DHS was informally discouraged from making the request by the defense department. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to make clear that the Department of Defense officials viewed the request as a law enforcement role. The Department of Homeland Security disputes that characterization, and the story has been updated with DHS comment.",

      "text": "(CNN) The political campaign video depicting a cop killer from Mexico that's become a key part of President Donald Trump's closing argument for the midterm elections isn't just an attempt to appeal to people's anxieties about immigration and crime, it's also based on a misleading — if not outright false — claim.\nThe video shows Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican man convicted in February of the 2014 slaying of two California deputies, declaring in court that he wanted to kill more cops, while text overlaid on the screen says, \"Democrats let him into our country\" and \"Democrats let him stay.\" A review of his case, however, shows multiple interactions with both local and federal officials during Republican and Democratic administrations, as well as noted anti-immigration firebrand Joe Arpaio, former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona. The video has been denounced by Democrats and some Republicans as racist for comparing Bracamontes with the caravans of migrants heading toward the US from Central America. But beyond the attempt to taint a group of people with the horrific actions of one, the details of Bracamontes' story also show it's simply false to blame Democrats for his entrance into the US. Read More Bracamontes had been arrested, been deported and re-entered the country multiple times before the 2014 killings, under both Republican and Democratic administrations. An Immigrations and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman told CNN in 2014 following his arrest that Bracamontes was arrested and deported twice, first in 1997 and then 2001, under the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. The last time he was known to have entered the US from Mexico was during the Bush administration, according to records obtained by the Sacramento Bee , which covered the killing of the two deputies, who were based in the area. Bracamontes was arrested multiple times in Maricopa County and jailed by Arpaio, who was pardoned by Trump last year after he was convicted of criminal contempt. Bracamontes was arrested in Maricopa County on drug charges in 1996, according to county court records, and was deported by ICE in 1997, the agency said. \"He was booked into the jails I run for drug-related convictions,\" Arpaio said in 2014, according to the Arizona Republic . \"He was evidently turned over to ICE and had been deported on two occasions.\" Bracamontes quickly returned to the US, and was arrested again by Arpaio in 1998, then released \"for reasons unknown,\" the Bee reported. Bracamontes was arrested yet again in 2001 on drug charges in Maricopa County, and was deported three days later. It's not clear when exactly he re-entered the country, but marriage records show he was back in the US by 2002. He was married in Maricopa County on Feb. 28, 2002, according to the Bee. In a 2014 interview with National Public Radio, Arpaio expressed regret that Bracamontes had \"slipped through the cracks.\" \"I don't know how many times he was arrested and slipped through the cracks. It's my gut feeling it wasn't just two times he's been deported,\" Arpaio said. CNN was unable to reach Arpaio for comment. The Trump video pivots from expletive-filled court footage of Bracamontes to scenes of migrant groups making their way through Mexico toward the US border — an overt suggestion that criminals like Bracamontes would be part of the caravan as the screen flashes \"Who else would Democrats let in?\" The video is part of a fear-based closing argument from Trump on immigration before Tuesday's election, which has included the President's announcement that up to15,000 US troops could be sent to the border, his call to end the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship and his stated intention to restrict US asylum rules. Trump has pushed all of these as efforts to stop the caravan despite the fact that the migrants are still weeks — or even months — away from reaching the US border. The tenor of the new video and the flurry of immigration announcements have been condemned by Democrats, and some moderate Republicans have also denounced them . \"This is a sickening ad,\" tweeted Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a Trump critic who is retiring. \"Republicans everywhere should denounce it.\" CNN's reporting on the ground with the migrants has shown a different picture than the one painted by Trump. During a week traveling with the migrants, CNN witnessed little, if any, organization. The people traveling have joined and left at will, CNN has reported, and say they are traveling in search of jobs and to escape hate and persecution. Trump's Bracamontes video is hardly the only Republican campaign ad that's suggested the migrants, traveling in groups, pose a threat to the US. Numerous GOP candidates in competitive races, including Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, have focused on the migrants in the closing days of the campaign. \"If you don't want America to be overrun by masses of illegal aliens and giant caravans, you'd better vote Republican,\" Trump said at his Missouri rally on Thursday. \"These are tough people. These are not angels. These are not little angels. These are tough people. And we're not letting them into our country. They're not coming in illegally.\" The Department of Homeland Security said in a \"myth vs. fact\" press release on Thursday that \"270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories, including known gang membership.\" It's not clear how the Trump administration arrived at that number. A DHS official would not elaborate because it was \"law enforcement sensitive.\" Friday morning, in comments at the Council on Foreign Relations, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen acknowledged that people legitimately seeking asylum are also part of the migrant group in addition to the criminals the administration is focusing on. \"(They) are proving to be quite violent. They are covering their faces, they are attacking the federal police there, attacking the military in Mexico,\" Nielsen said. \"They are putting the migrants, who are in the caravan, who are seeking asylum, at risk.\"",

      "text": "Ana Navarro is a Republican strategist and CNN political commentator. Follow her on Twitter @ananavarro . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. View more opinions on CNN.\n(CNN) My Florida absentee ballot had been sitting on my kitchen counter unopened for more than two weeks. Every day, I avoided it as if it was a Zika-infected mosquito. I finally filled it out, and then I schlepped it in my bag for a few more days before putting it in the mail. I was giving myself a chance to change my mind. I wanted to delay the unavoidable.\nI am a lifelong Republican. Since I began voting, I have always voted for Republicans running in state races in Florida. This year, I filled out my ballot for Democrat Andrew Gillum. And on Thursday, I finally put it in the mail. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, ran a primary campaign in which he portrayed himself as Donald Trump's Mini-Me. His signature issue during the primary was building a wall, which is weird because, well, Florida is not a border state. It's a peninsula surrounded by water on three sides. Trump weighed in heavily in favor of DeSantis during the primary, who is now deeply in his debt.. JUST WATCHED Gillum: DeSantis' monkey comment says it all Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nGillum: DeSantis' monkey comment says it all 02:08 I don't want a Trump echo chamber for governor in Florida. I want a governor who puts the interest of the state above loyalty to a president of his party. But I also did not want to vote for Gillum. I'm a centrist. He's a progressive. That word kind of scares me. Read More He wants to raise corporate taxes. I am against that. I think it would impede Florida's economic growth. There's an unresolved issue of an FBI investigation involving the city of Tallahassee while he was mayor. And then there are loyalty issues for me. My good friend Jeb Bush is supporting DeSantis. The man I'm about to marry, former Florida Republican Party Chairman Al Cardenas, is also supporting DeSantis. To say neither of them is a fan of Trump is an understatement. But they both think having a Republican governor, and avoiding gridlock in Tallahassee, supersedes the destructive influence of Trump. I disagree. Voting should not be group-think. We are all free to disagree with friends and even spouses (to be). The 2016 election taught us all an important lesson. Some things in life are binary choices. There is too much at stake in these elections. Often in Florida, elections are decided by 1 percentage point or less. Need I remind you of the 2000 presidential election, which was decided by just over 500 votes in Florida? Writing in Mickey Mouse is not an option. Leaving it blank is not an option. Throwing away your vote, is not an option. We have to vote for one of the two candidates who can actually win. I hoped that after the primary, DeSantis would distance himself from Trump. But instead, he doubled down. The race has been tinged with accusations of racism against DeSantis from day one. DeSantis now says he supports Trump's latest proposal of ending birthright citizenship. Birthright citizenship is granted by the 14th Amendment. Trump will be in Florida twice to headline rallies for DeSantis in the closing days of the campaign. These two are tied at the hip. JUST WATCHED Poll: Women powering Democrats' lead in Florida Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nPoll: Women powering Democrats' lead in Florida 01:55 Recent events have made voting for DeSantis that much more impossible. Cesar Sayoc , by all appearances a Trump sycophant, is accused of sending explosive devices through the mail, including three to my workplace, CNN. The sole perpetrator of these acts is the one who sent these explosives. But I believe, as do many other Americans, that Trump's divisive words contributed to triggering the alleged actions of an apparent madman. Both Gillum and I have been personally attacked by Trump. Both Gillum and I were the targets of Twitter threats by Sayoc. Within hours of Sayoc's court arraignment, Trump was attacking Gillum, calling him a \"thief\" and claiming that if elected, he would \"turn Florida into Venezuela.\" That last part really strikes a raw nerve for me. Like hundreds of thousands of other Floridians born in places such as Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, I fled a left-wing regime. Venezuela is ruled by a ruthless dictator who beats, jails and kills his political opponents. The inflation rate is just about at 1,000,000%. Under President Nicolas Maduro, Venezuelans lack even basic necessities such as food, toilet paper and medicine. To compare Gillum to Maduro is a scare tactic by a reckless demagogue. It cheapens the pain and trauma of the people of Venezuela. It is a bald-faced lie and impossibility. The state Legislature in Florida is Republican. Barring political apocalypse, it will remain Republican. Unlike Washington for the past two years, in Florida there would be checks and balances. Any major proposal Gillum may want made into law would require Republican cooperation. Politics in America have become so tribal, we need checks and balances. We need our co-equal branches of government retaining their independence. We do not need one becoming subservient to the other. That is why I'm splitting my vote and voting Republican for the state Cabinet and Legislature. JUST WATCHED Gillum responds to allegations of misused funds Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nGillum responds to allegations of misused funds 02:35 Until a few days ago, I had never met Gillum. Before the last debate, I spoke to him. We talked about policy and the controversy involving a couple of tickets to \"Hamilton.\" He agreed he should have been more vigilant about how the tickets got paid for. But folks, I voted for Rick Scott for governor, and I voted for Marco Rubio for US senator when they were both facing far more serious financial controversies. After talking to Gillum, I think he learned a lesson about the scrutiny and standards that come with public office. The higher the office, the higher the standard -- unless you are Donald Trump. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was the racist, anti-immigration ad Trump posted on Twitter the same night he came to Florida to hold a rally. Trump won the 2016 campaign through a divide-and-conquer strategy. In his campaign announcement a year earlier, Trump said Mexicans were \"bringing crime, they're rapists.\" He has not stopped blowing dog whistles and fabricating culture wars since. His response to Charlottesville, the Muslim ban, the National Anthem controversy ... the list is endless. It disgusts me that, not even a week after a madman who may have been triggered by the hysteria surrounding migrants killed 11 Jews in a house of worship in Pittsburgh, Trump is back to his old playbook of demonizing immigrants.

I am sure that if he wins, I will have some policy differences with him. And when I do, I will say so. The choice in Florida, and in many races across the United States, is clear. The 2018 election is a referendum on Trump and his attacks on our shared values, but more than that, it is a battle to define the heart and soul of America. Do we vote based on fear and angst and division? Or do we vote for an inspirational message of unity and a brighter future together. We each have a choice to make based on our own priorities. I'm going for unity. ",

      "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Thursday claimed he would sign an executive order \"next week\" aimed at restricting US asylum rules, as he seeks to use a group of Central American migrants heading for the US border as part of his midterm election closing argument.\nHe also suggested that the US troops he dispatched to the US-Mexico border could fire on someone in the migrant caravan if the person threw rocks or stones at them. In a meandering speech at the White House about immigration, Trump recycled many of the talking points he touts on the campaign trail -- but offered little in the way of concrete ways to address the problems he embellished. Trump said his administration is finalizing an executive action that would limit asylum claims to legal ports of entry, claiming migrants frequently abuse the system by fabricating their need for asylum. But he declined to specify how a change he described as a forthcoming executive order would work, or why he was convening a presidential address for a policy shift that is still in the preliminary stages. Read More Asked if he envisions US troops firing on anyone in the groups of migrants, Trump told reporters at the White House: \"I hope not. I hope not -- but it's the military.\" Trump shocks with racist new ad days before midterms \"I hope there won't be that,\" Trump said, but added that anybody throwing rocks or stones at the military service members will be considered to be using a firearm, \"because there's not much difference when you get hit in the face with a rock.\" Pentagon regulations only justify deadly force in face of threat A US defense official told CNN that the troops deployed to the border will be operating under the standard rules on the use of force and will only use such force in self-defense. Official Department of Defense regulations say \"deadly force is justified only when there is a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm to a person.\" Lt. Col. Jamie Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said following Trump's remarks that the Defense Department \"will not discuss hypothetical situations or specific measures within our rules on the use of force, but our forces are trained professionals who always have the inherent right of self-defense.\" \"I would also emphasize that our forces are in support of DHS/CBP, who are performing law enforcement activities,\" Davis said. Defense officials have repeatedly emphasized the troops at the border are there to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. The top general overseeing US Northern Command said on Tuesday that \"CBP (Customs and Border Protection) personnel are ... absolutely the primary and principal members that will be handling, specifically, the migrants.\" \"There could be incidental interaction between our military members and migrants or other personnel that might be in that area. And so we are making that our soldiers, our Marines are going to be fully trained in how to do that interaction,\" Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy said. The general added, \"They're going to understand the rules for that interaction, and they'll be consistent with CBP.\" Remarks come ahead of midterms Trump has focused increasingly on immigration heading into the final days of the midterms , as Republicans across the country struggle to match their opponents in drumming up voter enthusiasm. Trump did not release details on the asylum proposal or how it would be implemented, saying only that he intended to sign an order sometime next week restricting asylum claims. With three campaign rallies, a midterm election and a trip to France on the books, however, the President's schedule for next week is already crowded. The President said he would sign an immigration-related executive order next week, but was not specific as to what it would address. A White House aide had said earlier Thursday that Trump would unveil an executive action requiring migrants to request asylum at legal points of entry and preventing them from claiming asylum if they are caught crossing the border illegally. Although the President referenced such a policy in his speech, he offered no defense of how such a plan, once finalized, could be legal, given laws presently allowing migrants the right to claim asylum once they are on American soil. The Trump administration has been looking at ways to limit the number of asylum seekers, with the President and his allies often describing asylum as a \"loophole.\" The Immigration and Nationality Act says that anyone who arrives in the US \"whether or not at a designated port of arrival\" may apply for asylum if he or she has a \"well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\" Earlier this year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said victims of gang and domestic violence no longer qualify for asylum. \"Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even all serious problems, that people face every day all over the world,\" he said in June. As attorney general, Sessions has broad power over asylum procedures and the immigration courts, which are under the auspices of the Justice Department. Legal fight looms as Trump admin considers caravan order that could violate federal law He has also suggested that those claims should be rejected even before asylum seekers appear before a judge and begin court proceedings and that the simple fact of crossing the border illegally could also be a factor in rejecting an asylum claim. CNN reported earlier this week that the administration is also considering a plan to limit the number of migrants able to enter at legal ports of entry by \"metering,\" essentially creating a waitlist to allow people to enter only if the Department of Homeland Security has the capacity to process and detain them at one of its facilities, a department official said. In the past, the practice of metering has resulted in individuals deciding not to endure a lengthy wait to try to get into the country legally and instead to cross illegally. Should some of this group of migrants do the latter, they could face a tougher and higher standard for seeking asylum under the administration's plans. White House aides had considered having Trump deliver an immigration speech earlier in the week, but the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre on Saturday delayed those plans.",

      "title": "Roger Stone reveals he talked to Trump campaign about WikiLeaks in 2016 - CNNPolitics",
      "text": "(CNN) Roger Stone was in communication with at least one senior Trump campaign official about upcoming WikiLeaks disclosures during the 2016 presidential race, Stone revealed Thursday.\nIn an opinion piece for the right-wing Daily Caller, Stone published an exchange he had with Steve Bannon, then the chief executive of the Trump campaign. The emails are among the documents in special counsel Robert Mueller's possession as he investigates whether Stone had an inside-track with WikiLeaks and whether he shared any of that information with then-candidate Trump or Trump's inner circle. \"What was that this morning???\" Bannon wrote to Stone on October 4, 2016. Earlier that day, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had delivered a speech billed as an \"October surprise\" announcement and had promised additional Clinton-related leaks. But the event turned out to be a publicity stunt where Assange touted his organization's 10th anniversary. All Assange offered was another promise of more materials before the election, angering some Trump supporters who were hoping for a bombshell. Roger Stone beefs up his legal team Stone replied to Bannon that Assange didn't release any documents out of security concerns. Then Stone wrote, \"However -- a load every week going forward.\" In his column Thursday, Stone said this particular prediction was based on publicly available information. Read More \"More importantly my prediction of 'a load every week going forward' is based on Assange's own public announcement hours before-that there would be weekly releases going through and beyond the election and not any communication with Wikileaks or Assange,\" Stone wrote in his piece headlined \"The Treachery of Steve Bannon.\" Steve Bannon interviewed by Mueller's team for at least the third time While Stone says he still hasn't been contacted by the special counsel, nearly a dozen of his associates have been contacted for interviews with Mueller's team or testimony before the grand jury. Last week, Mueller's team interviewed Bannon for a third time, including about his communications with Stone. Stone's move to publish the emails pre-empted a New York Times story Thursday about Stone's efforts to pitch himself to Trump campaign officials as a WikiLeaks insider. At least one campaign official told investigators that Stone told campaign officials he had ties to Assange, according to a person familiar with the investigation. Stone made a variety of pronouncements during the 2016 campaign suggesting he had ties to Assange or advance knowledge about what WikiLeaks was planning to release. The timing of the email exchange between Stone and Bannon could also be of interest to investigators. Days later, on October 7, 2016, WikiLeaks unveiled the hacked emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. It was convenient timing for the Trump campaign. It came about 30 minutes after one of the most damaging moments of Trump's presidential campaign: when a recording became public showing Trump bragging about grabbing women's genitals in previously unaired footage from a 2005 interview with 'Access Hollywood.' Mueller drills down on Roger Stone's WikiLeaks contacts While Stone made a show -- publicly and privately -- of bragging about his close ties to Assange during the 2016 campaign, he has since revised his story. Stone said he relied on publicly available information, tips from journalists and a backchannel source -- progressive New York activist and radio host Randy Credico. Credico, who has been interviewed multiple times by investigators and testified before the grand jury, has denied that he acted as Stone's backchannel. It remains unclear what charges Stone could face, if any. In a separate email published by The New York Times, Stone encourages Bannon to have Trump campaign surrogates tout a story -- without any evidence -- that Bill Clinton has a love child. Roger Stone aide hopes Kavanaugh will support his case against Mueller Then he asks Bannon to have GOP donor Rebekah Mercer fund his efforts to spread the Clinton story. \"I've raise (sic) $150K for the targeted black digital campaign thru a C-4,\" Stone wrote. \"Tell Rebecca to send us some $$$.\" The request could run afoul of federal election law. On Thursday, Stone told CNN he never received any money from the Mercers. ",

      "text": "Ana Navarro is a Republican strategist and CNN political commentator. Follow her on Twitter @ananavarro . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. View more opinions on CNN.\n(CNN) My Florida absentee ballot had been sitting on my kitchen counter unopened for more than two weeks. Every day, I avoided it as if it was a Zika-infected mosquito. I finally filled it out, and then I schlepped it in my bag for a few more days before putting it in the mail. I was giving myself a chance to change my mind. I wanted to delay the unavoidable.\nI am a lifelong Republican. Since I began voting, I have always voted for Republicans running in state races in Florida. This year, I filled out my ballot for Democrat Andrew Gillum. And on Thursday, I finally put it in the mail. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, ran a primary campaign in which he portrayed himself as Donald Trump's Mini-Me. His signature issue during the primary was building a wall, which is weird because, well, Florida is not a border state. It's a peninsula surrounded by water on three sides. Trump weighed in heavily in favor of DeSantis during the primary, who is now deeply in his debt.. JUST WATCHED Gillum: DeSantis' monkey comment says it all Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nGillum: DeSantis' monkey comment says it all 02:08 I don't want a Trump echo chamber for governor in Florida. I want a governor who puts the interest of the state above loyalty to a president of his party. But I also did not want to vote for Gillum. I'm a centrist. He's a progressive. That word kind of scares me. Read More He wants to raise corporate taxes. I am against that. I think it would impede Florida's economic growth. There's an unresolved issue of an FBI investigation involving the city of Tallahassee while he was mayor. And then there are loyalty issues for me. My good friend Jeb Bush is supporting DeSantis. The man I'm about to marry, former Florida Republican Party Chairman Al Cardenas, is also supporting DeSantis. To say neither of them is a fan of Trump is an understatement. But they both think having a Republican governor, and avoiding gridlock in Tallahassee, supersedes the destructive influence of Trump. I disagree. Voting should not be group-think. We are all free to disagree with friends and even spouses (to be). The 2016 election taught us all an important lesson. Some things in life are binary choices. There is too much at stake in these elections. Often in Florida, elections are decided by 1 percentage point or less. Need I remind you of the 2000 presidential election, which was decided by just over 500 votes in Florida? Writing in Mickey Mouse is not an option. Leaving it blank is not an option. Throwing away your vote, is not an option. We have to vote for one of the two candidates who can actually win. I hoped that after the primary, DeSantis would distance himself from Trump. But instead, he doubled down. The race has been tinged with accusations of racism against DeSantis from day one. DeSantis now says he supports Trump's latest proposal of ending birthright citizenship. Birthright citizenship is granted by the 14th Amendment. Trump will be in Florida twice to headline rallies for DeSantis in the closing days of the campaign. These two are tied at the hip. JUST WATCHED Poll: Women powering Democrats' lead in Florida Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nPoll: Women powering Democrats' lead in Florida 01:55 Recent events have made voting for DeSantis that much more impossible. Cesar Sayoc , by all appearances a Trump sycophant, is accused of sending explosive devices through the mail, including three to my workplace, CNN. The sole perpetrator of these acts is the one who sent these explosives. But I believe, as do many other Americans, that Trump's divisive words contributed to triggering the alleged actions of an apparent madman. Both Gillum and I have been personally attacked by Trump. Both Gillum and I were the targets of Twitter threats by Sayoc. Within hours of Sayoc's court arraignment, Trump was attacking Gillum, calling him a \"thief\" and claiming that if elected, he would \"turn Florida into Venezuela.\" That last part really strikes a raw nerve for me. Like hundreds of thousands of other Floridians born in places such as Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, I fled a left-wing regime. Venezuela is ruled by a ruthless dictator who beats, jails and kills his political opponents. The inflation rate is just about at 1,000,000%. Under President Nicolas Maduro, Venezuelans lack even basic necessities such as food, toilet paper and medicine. To compare Gillum to Maduro is a scare tactic by a reckless demagogue. It cheapens the pain and trauma of the people of Venezuela. It is a bald-faced lie and impossibility. The state Legislature in Florida is Republican. Barring political apocalypse, it will remain Republican. Unlike Washington for the past two years, in Florida there would be checks and balances. Any major proposal Gillum may want made into law would require Republican cooperation. Politics in America have become so tribal, we need checks and balances. We need our co-equal branches of government retaining their independence. We do not need one becoming subservient to the other. That is why I'm splitting my vote and voting Republican for the state Cabinet and Legislature. JUST WATCHED Gillum responds to allegations of misused funds Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nGillum responds to allegations of misused funds 02:35 Until a few days ago, I had never met Gillum. Before the last debate, I spoke to him. We talked about policy and the controversy involving a couple of tickets to \"Hamilton.\" He agreed he should have been more vigilant about how the tickets got paid for. But folks, I voted for Rick Scott for governor, and I voted for Marco Rubio for US senator when they were both facing far more serious financial controversies. After talking to Gillum, I think he learned a lesson about the scrutiny and standards that come with public office. The higher the office, the higher the standard -- unless you are Donald Trump. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was the racist, anti-immigration ad Trump posted on Twitter the same night he came to Florida to hold a rally. Trump won the 2016 campaign through a divide-and-conquer strategy. In his campaign announcement a year earlier, Trump said Mexicans were \"bringing crime, they're rapists.\" He has not stopped blowing dog whistles and fabricating culture wars since. His response to Charlottesville, the Muslim ban, the National Anthem controversy ... the list is endless. It disgusts me that, not even a week after a madman who may have been triggered by the hysteria surrounding migrants killed 11 Jews in a house of worship in Pittsburgh, Trump is back to his old playbook of demonizing immigrants. For more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter .\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\nGillum is out there, a happy warrior campaigning on a positive message. I am sure that if he wins, I will have some policy differences with him. And when I do, I will say so. The choice in Florida, and in many races across the United States, is clear. The 2018 election is a referendum on Trump and his attacks on our shared values, but more than that, it is a battle to define the heart and soul of America. Do we vote based on fear and angst and division? Or do we vote for an inspirational message of unity and a brighter future together. We each have a choice to make based on our own priorities. I'm going for unity.",

      "text": "(CNN) On Thursday night, just hours after giving what amounted to a campaign speech on immigration in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, President Donald Trump jetted to Missouri to rally support for Republican Josh Hawley's challenge to Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill.\nAs has been the case of late, Trump's speech was peppered with a series of false claims -- primarily focused on the group of migrants making their way across Mexico at the moment -- and reliable applause lines about Democrats pushing for open border and socialism. Below, the 46 lines that stood out to me. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n1. \"I see these signs all over place, 'Tigers for Trump.' I like that.\" And away we go ! 2. \"She'll never vote. She'll never vote. She never has, and she didn't even vote for Justice Kavanaugh.\" Read More Trump's not wrong about this. McCaskill did vote against Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. Of course, so did every other Senate Democrat other than Joe Manchin of West Virginia. 3. \"More Americans are working now than any time in history.\" This is also true! But as I've noted many, many times before, there are simply more Americans than at any previous time in American history. So it makes sense that there are also more Americans working. 4. \"So today, right now, we have more Americans working than at any time, any time in the history of our country. That's pretty good. That's pretty good.\" It is good. But Trump taking credit for it is sort of like taking credit for the sun rising. Like, it's good that it happened, but he didn't, you know, do it. 5. \"That'll be a very good sound bite in the debate when we face one of those Democrats, whoever it may be.\" What's remarkable about Trump is not that he's always making political calculations, but how willing he is to air those calculations publicly. More people than ever before is good because it will make a good sound bite against a Democrat in the 2020 presidential race. 6. \"So we've done in less than two years what any other president or administration did in four years, in eight years, or, in one case, in more than eight years.\" It's very, very hard to quantify Trump's claim here for the sake of comparison to past presidents. Even if you isolate just Trump's oft-repeated boast that he has cut more regulations than any past president, The Washington Post Fact Checker noted that it's virtually impossible to decide whether that's true or not. 7. \"Republicans passed a massive tax cut for working families, and we will soon follow it up with another 10% tax cut for the middle class.\" Trump initially suggested that the 10% tax cut was coming before the election, which was always ridiculous. ( Trump admitted as much earlier this week .) And the only way another tax cut is coming is if Republicans hold the House in four days' time, which doesn't seem terribly likely. 8. \"The Democrat agenda is the agenda of the extreme far left. They've gone crazy, folks. They've gone totally loco.\" Not just crazy. Totally loco!!! Trump laments that 'two maniacs' stopped GOP momentum in midterms 9. \"You can't have dinner. You can't have dinner. Do you see what they're doing to our people?\" It took me a few reads but I realized that Trump is referencing to liberal activists harassing people like Mitch McConnell or Sarah Sanders when they are out to dinner. Which is, without question, something that has conservatives up in arms. 10. \"And we're being so nice. We're being so nice. And let's stay being nice, right? We'll stay being nice. Because we are tough as hell. We -- we're going to stay nice.\" So, wait. Are we being nice? Or tough as hell? Can we be both? 11. \"Don't forget: We've got the police. Law enforcement loves us.\" Ominous! 12. \"I said to the police the other day, we're so high in the polls, we're trying to figure out who is representing the other side? We don't even know. We want to figure it out.\" I genuinely have no idea what he is talking about here. Truly. 13. \"The vets are for us. The veterans are all for us.\" All veterans? This feels like it might not be entirely true. 14. \"We don't run around like Antifa with their little arms and then go home back home into mommy's basement and put on the black uniform and the black helmet. Oh, it's so disappointing when those helmets fall off and you look at this weak little face, isn't it?\" ... said the President of the United States. 15. \"The Democrats lie.\" In his first 649 days in office, Trump said 6,420 things that were either totally false or misleading, according to The Washington Post's Fact Checker . 16. \"They all want to do it. We're going to the make -- lots of great things are going to happen over the next short period of time.\" Well, I'm convinced! And apparently, so are \"they.\" 17. \"Let me tell you, we would be in a nuclear war right now if the right person didn't come along.\" In which Trump claims that had he not been elected, there was a 100% chance that America would be in the midst of a nuclear war with North Korea. 18. \"We're doing great. As a country, we're doing great. We've never done better. We are doing really well.\" Point of clarification: Are we doing well? 19. \"We just have to go around 'em, and we have gone around them like nobody in history has ever gone around them.\" Trump's talking about the media here. And there are two things worth noting: 1) He's \"gone around\" the media by telling his supporters his own version of the truth, which doesn't comport with established facts and 2) Even in this, Trump has to always have done it the best or more than anyone else. 20. \"I want the cleanest water on the planet. We want the cleanest air on the planet. And we've got it.\" [narrator voice] No, we don't. 21. \"The only time I've seen them, they underestimate the crowd. They want to underestimate that crowd, which is easy for them, actually, to do. But that's a lot of people.\" It's not clear who the \"they\" is that Trump is accusing of underestimating the size of the caravan, which has been estimated at more than 7,000 people. It's also not clear why Trump knows there are more people in the caravan than people are estimating. 22. \"You know, I think what happened -- I really believe somebody was involved that's not on our side of the ledger. Somebody was involved.\" The President is playing conspiracy theorist in chief here: Suggesting that the caravan was organized by Democrats despite zero available evidence to back up that claim. 23. \"Look what we got, Foxconn, one of the great companies of the world, what they did in Wisconsin for Gov. Walker.\" According to the Real Clear Politics , Walker is losing in seven out of the last 10 polls done in his race. 24. \"I want to give him full credit, because, I'll tell you what, I gave him that one, and he took it, and got it done.\" This is amazing. Trump wants to make sure Walker gets full credit for bringing Foxconn to Wisconsin even though \"I gave him that one.\" R ght. 25. \"You have to see what they built in Wisconsin. Scott Walker.\" \"Hansel. So hot right now. Hansel.\" -- Jacobim Mugatu 26. \"We defeated the Democrat mob and proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, who was treated very, very unfairly, by the way, Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\" This is an interesting way to frame the Kavanaugh confirmation fight which was primarily focused on the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both teenagers. 27. \"This will be the election of Kavanaugh, the caravans, law and order, tax cuts, and common sense. Common sense.\" This is a regular Trump line in these closing days -- and evidence, not that you needed it, that Trump's closing message is entirely focused on motivating his base. 28. \"It's happening faster than anybody can believe. You know, it's all happening much faster than anybody could believe.\" Did he say \" it's all happening \" 29. \"Even one of them recently said that President Trump made promises, but he's kept many more promises. I mean, far more than I made.\" [gets out scratch paper] So, you say you've kept more promises than you've made, eh? OK, let me just calculate that out.... [head explodes] 30. \"It's true. It's true.\" [narrator voice] It's not. You can't keep more promises than you've made. Everyone knows that. OK, not everyone. 31. \"And nobody in this room -- I see a couple of guys that wouldn't mind, I see a couple of people. I see one woman there that wouldn't mind, too. But nobody here wants to do that. And they do it.\" Trump -- I think -- is talking about how tough ICE agents are. I think. But what I know is that they \"do that.\" And they don't mind doing that. (No, I don't know what \"that\" is.) 32. \"These people, they call them nests. You go into a nest. They are bad. Everyone needs to show up and vote for Josh Hawley. Please do it.\" Holy non sequitor, Batman! Trump slams 'crazy, lunatic' constitutional amendment in midterm endgame 33. \"Democrats are the party of open borders, socialism, and crime, whether you like it or not.\" Maybe it's just me, but this feels like a bit of an oversimplification? 34. \"Hundreds of thousands of children born to illegal immigrants are made automatic citizens of the United States every year because of this crazy, lunatic policy that we can end.\" The \"crazy, lunatic\" policy that Trump is referring to is also known as the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. 35. \"If you want your children to have a country, vote Republican.\" So, if you vote Democratic, the US will cease to exist? 36. \"If you don't want America to be overrun by masses of illegal aliens and giant caravans, you'd better vote Republican.\" To be clear: The caravan that Trump spends so much time talking about is still hundreds of miles from the US border. And the idea that this group will \"overrun\" America is fear-mongering, plain and simple. 37. \"We're the hot country. Can you believe it?\" \"Hansel. So hot right now. Hansel.\" -- Jacobim Mugatu 38. \"You know, I meet a lot of leaders. They're great, you know, some of them. Some I like, some I don't like. What the hell.\" [speechless] 39. \"And then when the election was over, they said, you know, it's an amazing thing. He did great with women. What the hell.\" Trump got 41% of the women's vote in 2016 . No one said that was \"an amazing thing.\" 40. \"That's why we're doing great with women, and we always have done well with women.\" [narrator voice] He hasn't. 41. \"And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces. It's called the Space Force.\" Mars Awaits! 42. \"These are the midterms. Nobody thought of the midterms as being that big a deal for years. For years. Nobody thought of the midterms.\" Uh... 43. \"Now, we did have two maniacs stop our momentum that was incredible, because for seven days, nobody talked about the election to stop the tremendous momentum.\" So, Trump sees the mail bomber and the synagogue shooter as \"maniacs\" who stopped his campaign momentum. OK! This is fine! Nothing to see here folks! 44. \"You must reject the Democrat politics of anger and hatred and division and fear.\" Reminder: Donald Trump's closing message in this campaign is that horde of illegal immigrants is about to surge across the border and take everything you love and care about. So 45. \"It was right here in Missouri that the great explorers, Lewis and Clark -- that's very impressive -- that's very impressive, Lewis and Clark -- that's big time -- began their epic journey across the American West.\" \"That's big time.\" -- The President of the United States on Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. 46. \"We will never surrender, ever, ever, ever.\" Ever? This feels like a good place to end.",

      "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Thursday claimed he would sign an executive order \"next week\" aimed at restricting US asylum rules, as he seeks to use a group of Central American migrants heading for the US border as part of his midterm election closing argument.\nHe also suggested that the US troops he dispatched to the US-Mexico border could fire on someone in the migrant caravan if the person threw rocks or stones at them. In a meandering speech at the White House about immigration, Trump recycled many of the talking points he touts on the campaign trail -- but offered little in the way of concrete ways to address the problems he embellished. Trump said his administration is finalizing an executive action that would limit asylum claims to legal ports of entry, claiming migrants frequently abuse the system by fabricating their need for asylum. But he declined to specify how a change he described as a forthcoming executive order would work, or why he was convening a presidential address for a policy shift that is still in the preliminary stages. Read More Asked if he envisions US troops firing on anyone in the groups of migrants, Trump told reporters at the White House: \"I hope not. I hope not -- but it's the military.\" Trump shocks with racist new ad days before midterms \"I hope there won't be that,\" Trump said, but added that anybody throwing rocks or stones at the military service members will be considered to be using a firearm, \"because there's not much difference when you get hit in the face with a rock.\" Pentagon regulations only justify deadly force in face of threat A US defense official told CNN that the troops deployed to the border will be operating under the standard rules on the use of force and will only use such force in self-defense. Official Department of Defense regulations say \"deadly force is justified only when there is a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm to a person.\" Lt. Col. Jamie Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said following Trump's remarks that the Defense Department \"will not discuss hypothetical situations or specific measures within our rules on the use of force, but our forces are trained professionals who always have the inherent right of self-defense.\" \"I would also emphasize that our forces are in support of DHS/CBP, who are performing law enforcement activities,\" Davis said. Defense officials have repeatedly emphasized the troops at the border are there to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. The top general overseeing US Northern Command said on Tuesday that \"CBP (Customs and Border Protection) personnel are ... absolutely the primary and principal members that will be handling, specifically, the migrants.\" \"There could be incidental interaction between our military members and migrants or other personnel that might be in that area. And so we are making that our soldiers, our Marines are going to be fully trained in how to do that interaction,\" Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy said. The general added, \"They're going to understand the rules for that interaction, and they'll be consistent with CBP.\" Remarks come ahead of midterms Trump has focused increasingly on immigration heading into the final days of the midterms , as Republicans across the country struggle to match their opponents in drumming up voter enthusiasm. Trump did not release details on the asylum proposal or how it would be implemented, saying only that he intended to sign an order sometime next week restricting asylum claims. With three campaign rallies, a midterm election and a trip to France on the books, however, the President's schedule for next week is already crowded. The President said he would sign an immigration-related executive order next week, but was not specific as to what it would address. A White House aide had said earlier Thursday that Trump would unveil an executive action requiring migrants to request asylum at legal points of entry and preventing them from claiming asylum if they are caught crossing the border illegally. Although the President referenced such a policy in his speech, he offered no defense of how such a plan, once finalized, could be legal, given laws presently allowing migrants the right to claim asylum once they are on American soil. The Trump administration has been looking at ways to limit the number of asylum seekers, with the President and his allies often describing asylum as a \"loophole.\" The Immigration and Nationality Act says that anyone who arrives in the US \"whether or not at a designated port of arrival\" may apply for asylum if he or she has a \"well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\" Earlier this year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said victims of gang and domestic violence no longer qualify for asylum. \"Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even all serious problems, that people face every day all over the world,\" he said in June. As attorney general, Sessions has broad power over asylum procedures and the immigration courts, which are under the auspices of the Justice Department. Legal fight looms as Trump admin considers caravan order that could violate federal law He has also suggested that those claims should be rejected even before asylum seekers appear before a judge and begin court proceedings and that the simple fact of crossing the border illegally could also be a factor in rejecting an asylum claim. CNN reported earlier this week that the administration is also considering a plan to limit the number of migrants able to enter at legal ports of entry by \"metering,\" essentially creating a waitlist to allow people to enter only if the Department of Homeland Security has the capacity to process and detain them at one of its facilities, a department official said. In the past, the practice of metering has resulted in individuals deciding not to endure a lengthy wait to try to get into the country legally and instead to cross illegally. Should some of this group of migrants do the latter, they could face a tougher and higher standard for seeking asylum under the administration's plans. White House aides had considered having Trump deliver an immigration speech earlier in the week, but the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre on Saturday delayed those plans. ",

      "title": "Trump video accused as racist also lacks factual basis - CNNPolitics",
      "text": "(CNN) The political campaign video depicting a cop killer from Mexico that's become a key part of President Donald Trump's closing argument for the midterm elections isn't just an attempt to appeal to people's anxieties about immigration and crime, it's also based on a misleading — if not outright false — claim.\nThe video shows Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican man convicted in February of the 2014 slaying of two California deputies, declaring in court that he wanted to kill more cops, while text overlaid on the screen says, \"Democrats let him into our country\" and \"Democrats let him stay.\" A review of his case, however, shows multiple interactions with both local and federal officials during Republican and Democratic administrations, as well as noted anti-immigration firebrand Joe Arpaio, former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona. The video has been denounced by Democrats and some Republicans as racist for comparing Bracamontes with the caravans of migrants heading toward the US from Central America. But beyond the attempt to taint a group of people with the horrific actions of one, the details of Bracamontes' story also show it's simply false to blame Democrats for his entrance into the US. Read More Bracamontes had been arrested, been deported and re-entered the country multiple times before the 2014 killings, under both Republican and Democratic administrations. An Immigrations and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman told CNN in 2014 following his arrest that Bracamontes was arrested and deported twice, first in 1997 and then 2001, under the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. The last time he was known to have entered the US from Mexico was during the Bush administration, according to records obtained by the Sacramento Bee , which covered the killing of the two deputies, who were based in the area. Bracamontes was arrested multiple times in Maricopa County and jailed by Arpaio, who was pardoned by Trump last year after he was convicted of criminal contempt. Bracamontes was arrested in Maricopa County on drug charges in 1996, according to county court records, and was deported by ICE in 1997, the agency said. \"He was booked into the jails I run for drug-related convictions,\" Arpaio said in 2014, according to the Arizona Republic . \"He was evidently turned over to ICE and had been deported on two occasions.\" Bracamontes quickly returned to the US, and was arrested again by Arpaio in 1998, then released \"for reasons unknown,\" the Bee reported. Bracamontes was arrested yet again in 2001 on drug charges in Maricopa County, and was deported three days later. It's not clear when exactly he re-entered the country, but marriage records show he was back in the US by 2002. He was married in Maricopa County on Feb. 28, 2002, according to the Bee. In a 2014 interview with National Public Radio, Arpaio expressed regret that Bracamontes had \"slipped through the cracks.\" \"I don't know how many times he was arrested and slipped through the cracks. It's my gut feeling it wasn't just two times he's been deported,\" Arpaio said. CNN was unable to reach Arpaio for comment. The Trump video pivots from expletive-filled court footage of Bracamontes to scenes of migrant groups making their way through Mexico toward the US border — an overt suggestion that criminals like Bracamontes would be part of the caravan as the screen flashes \"Who else would Democrats let in?\" The video is part of a fear-based closing argument from Trump on immigration before Tuesday's election, which has included the President's announcement that up to15,000 US troops could be sent to the border, his call to end the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship and his stated intention to restrict US asylum rules. Trump has pushed all of these as efforts to stop the caravan despite the fact that the migrants are still weeks — or even months — away from reaching the US border. The tenor of the new video and the flurry of immigration announcements have been condemned by Democrats, and some moderate Republicans have also denounced them . \"This is a sickening ad,\" tweeted Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a Trump critic who is retiring. \"Republicans everywhere should denounce it.\" CNN's reporting on the ground with the migrants has shown a different picture than the one painted by Trump. During a week traveling with the migrants, CNN witnessed little, if any, organization. The people traveling have joined and left at will, CNN has reported, and say they are traveling in search of jobs and to escape hate and persecution. Trump's Bracamontes video is hardly the only Republican campaign ad that's suggested the migrants, traveling in groups, pose a threat to the US. Numerous GOP candidates in competitive races, including Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, have focused on the migrants in the closing days of the campaign. \"If you don't want America to be overrun by masses of illegal aliens and giant caravans, you'd better vote Republican,\" Trump said at his Missouri rally on Thursday. \"These are tough people. These are not angels. These are not little angels. These are tough people. And we're not letting them into our country. They're not coming in illegally.\" The Department of Homeland Security said in a \"myth vs. fact\" press release on Thursday that \"270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories, including known gang membership.\" It's not clear how the Trump administration arrived at that number. A DHS official would not elaborate because it was \"law enforcement sensitive.\" Friday morning, in comments at the Council on Foreign Relations, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen acknowledged that people legitimately seeking asylum are also part of the migrant group in addition to the criminals the administration is focusing on. \"(They) are proving to be quite violent. They are covering their faces, they are attacking the federal police there, attacking the military in Mexico,\" Nielsen said. \"They are putting the migrants, who are in the caravan, who are seeking asylum, at risk.\" ",

      "text": "(CNN) Actor Alec Baldwin was arrested and charged with assault and harassment Friday following a dispute over a parking spot, according to New York police.\nNYPD Lieutenant John Grimpel told CNN the incident occurred on 10th Street in Manhattan. A 49-year-old man sustained an injury to the left jaw after being punched and was taken to a local area hospital to be treated, police said. He's in stable condition, police added. Baldwin was charged with assault and harassment and given a desk appearance ticket, the NYPD said. A representative for Baldwin had no comment when reached by CNN. However, a series of tweets on the Hilaria and Alec Baldwin Foundation account that appear to be from the actor denied the allegations. Read More \"Normally, I would not comment on something as egregiously misstated as today's story. However, the assertion that I punched anyone over a parking spot is false. I wanted to go on the record stating as much,\" the tweets read. \"I realize that it has become a sport to tag people w as many negative charges and defaming allegations as possible for the purposes of clickbait entertainment. \"Fortunately, no matter how reverberating the echos, it doesn't make the statements true.\" In addition to portraying president Donald Trump on \"Saturday Night Live,\" Baldwin currently hosts a Sunday talk show on ABC, called \"The Alec Baldwin Show.\" As he was heading to a campaign event on Friday, President Trump was asked about Baldwin's arrest. In response, Trump shrugged his shoulders and said, \"I wish him luck.\" Baldwin will appear in court at a later date, according to the NYPD.",

      "text": "Washington (CNN) The uncle of White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said Friday that the Central American migrants seeking asylum are just like his Jewish ancestors who fled Europe and came to the US as refugees before World War II.\n\"They are just like our family,\" David Glosser told CNN's Alisyn Camerota in an interview on \"New Day.\" \"We needed to come here. We needed to find someplace to go and those that couldn't suffered the consequences.\" Stephen Miller's uncle: 'I felt it was incumbent upon me to raise my voice' against administration's immigration policy President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that he'll sign an executive order \"next week\" aimed at restricting US asylum claims to legal ports of entry. The President has been warning of an \"invasion\" at the US border by the caravan of Central American migrants, who are still making their way through Mexico. He has sent US troops to the border and, without evidence, claimed that criminals and gang leaders are among the caravan travelers. \"We are getting no moral leadership from the President, who is happy to condemn these people who are like our family, like my family,\" Glosser told CNN. He argued that there's \"institutional, political racism sweeping across the country, focused on vilifying people that you don't know, people who really are just like us.\" Read More Glosser, a retired neuropsychologist, wrote an op-ed in August in which he called his nephew an \"immigration hypocrite\" and blasted Miller's central involvement in crafting the Trump administration's immigration policies . Glosser said that his family would not have survived World War II and the Holocaust if they did not have the opportunity to immigrate to the US as refugees back in the early 1900s, before the enactment of the 1924 Immigration Act that limited the entry of eastern and southern European immigrants.

      "text": "Alice Driver is a freelance journalist and translator whose work focuses on migration, human rights and gender equality. She is based in Mexico City.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\nJuchitán, Mexico (CNN) At 27 days old, Rachel had already traveled 316 miles with the migrant caravan, mostly in her mother Yesenia's arms. The pair left Guatemala with Yesenia's husband, Ernesto, and their 4 and 6-year-old daughters. Ernesto had recently lost his job and Yesenia was unemployed, and they were afraid of not being able to provide basic necessities for their daughters. Although the couple admitted that it had been difficult to read the news that President Donald Trump would send troops to the border, they hoped to request asylum in the US and prayed that God would help the President understand the hardships they had lived through.\nAlice Driver Yesenia, who had delivered via C-section, was unable to carry anything except Rachel, and she and Rachel depended on the kindness of strangers to give them a ride while her husband walked long, hot miles each day pushing the other two girls in a stroller. Were Rachel, Yesenia and their family the \"bad thugs\" and \"gang members\" of the migrant caravan that Trump had warned of on Twitter? They were not -- in fact, they were representative of the roughly 3,500 migrants of the caravan, of which an estimated 2,300 are children, according to UNICEF. The truth about this migrant caravan is that it is made up of grandparents, parents and children, of individuals fleeing such a level of violence and poverty that they are ready, like Yesenia, to walk and hitchhike thousands of miles in hopes of finding a new life further north. The caravan, which had about 7,000 members when it began in San Pedro Sula, Honduras on October 12, continues to shrink. This is, in part, because, according to the United Nations refugee agency, around 1,500 migrants have requested asylum in Mexico, while others in the face of sickness or injury are sometimes forced to turn back. By the time the migrant caravan reaches the US-Mexico border, the numbers will likely drop further. Read More A group of women, including a mother and daughter, rest on the side of the road and share water en route to Juchitán, Oaxaca. As I interviewed members of the caravan while they moved from Niltepec, Mexico to Juchitán, Mexico, I met families with babies and young children, pregnant women, adolescents looking for work, and old men and women with severe, oozing blisters. Almost everyone was wearing flip flops, hardly the ideal footwear for terrorists, as the President had suggested , and not one of the people I met was from the Middle East, yet another claim made by Trump without any seeming evidence to back it up. Even he later admitted \"there's no proof\" to the claim. I observed residents of a working-class neighborhood in Juchitán, who despite living in homes with dirt floors in an informal settlement, organized to provide both food and showers to the migrants, who they called their brothers and sisters. They want to support the migrants if they choose to request asylum in Mexico, which some could do, or to go on to the US, where many migrants have at least some family members. The migrants were provided shelter in an old bus station, and community volunteers and aid organizations like the Red Cross handed out blankets, clothes and medicine. Isaac, 2, is traveling with his mother Paola, 22, and his brother Carlos, 3, from San Pedro Sula, Honduras. They have been walking with the migrant caravan since it began. That night, I met 4-month-old Esmerelda, who was nestled between her mother Kayla's legs. The two had walked from Santa Bárbara, Honduras, and along the way kind citizens had given Kayla diapers and milk for the baby. Kayla, like so many others in the caravan, wanted to escape extreme poverty and a country in which daughters like her own were often forced to quit elementary school to work and help support the family. Paola, 22, a single mother, had traveled from San Pedro Sula, Honduras with her sons age 2 and 3. She left Honduras because she wanted to be able to offer her sons a better life, one in which violent gangs like MS-13 were not a part of their daily reality. Her mother lived in Canada and she hoped to start a new life there. Lillian, a young mother wearing a hat to combat temperatures that hovered around 100 degrees during the day, was traveling with her 1-year-old son, Tiago, and her husband. As she stood on the side of the road with Tiago in her arms, she talked about her husband, a farmer, and how difficult his work had become due to water scarcity and extreme temperatures. Their family was among many migrants propelled to move by climate change. They had sold everything except her child's clothes to have money for the journey. They wanted to request asylum in the US, but their dream was to one day return to Tegucigalpa, Honduras and build a house. Lillian from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, is traveling with her son Tiago, 1, and she has worn flip flops, often the only shoes migrants can afford. As I stood in the old bus station surrounded by a sea of humanity that night, I saw kids playing with balloons, girls from plates heaped with beans and tortillas, babies sleeping soundly, community members handing out diapers, and volunteers setting up a viewing of the movie \"Coco\" powered by solar energy. I met a single mother and her four children who had fled the political unrest in Nicaragua, a country where over 300 people were killed in protesting the government's decision to cut pensions. When I met her, she was standing in the grass trying to brush her youngest daughter's hair. I also met a US pediatric doctor who had spent a week volunteering with the caravan, and who said that it was irresponsible for Trump to call members of the migrant caravan criminals. \"Don't treat them like criminals,\" he said. \"So much of the blame for this migration falls on the United States.\" For more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter .\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\nAlthough President Trump has suggested he may limit how many migrants can apply for asylum, according to US and international law, these migrants all have the right to request asylum at the US-Mexico border. Members of the migrant caravan, who have suffered more than most US citizens can imagine, must be given the opportunity to go through the legal process that will determine if they get to stay in the US. At heart, we have always been a nation of immigrants, a nation that has faith in our institutions and that has provided refuge to those fleeing extreme violence and poverty. Trump has tried to erode that faith and turn a hungry, tired mass of migrants with sunburned faces and bleeding feet into something to fear. Regardless of whether Trump actually sends 15,000 troops to the border, the migrants that I talked to said they would always be more afraid of hunger and death than of a president who disliked them based on the color of their skin.

      "text": "Midterm Elections Published 1 hour ago Maxine Waters, Schiff among high-profile Dems poised to control committees if House flips By Gregg Re close Video Nancy Pelosi predicts Democrats will take back the House House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi appears supremely confident that she will lead the Democratic Party back to the majority in the House.\nA hard-charging New York congressman who forced his way into a federal immigration detention facility.\nAn intensely private Baltimore representative who says he just wants to cut through the \"unnecessary BS\" and get to \"the facts.\"\nA take-no-prisoners Los Angeles Democrat who has called on supporters to \"push back\" on Trump administration officials in public -- as many progressive activists took to restaurants and university events to do just that.\nThey&apos;re all part of the cast of prominent and lesser-known Democrats who have spent the past two years openly sparring with President Trump, and who are now poised to assume control of key committees if Republicans lose control of the House of Representatives in Tuesday&apos;s midterm elections.\nTrump, for his part, has vowed to fight back , saying in an interview with The Washington Times that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, was breaking the law by threatening last week that Democrats would use subpoena power as a \"negotiating\" tool. As Pelosi eyes reclaiming the speakership if her party takes power, numerous ranking members are lining up for influential jobs below her.\nTRUMP MAY TAKE PELOSI SUBPOENA THREAT TO SUPREME COURT\nMaxine Waters - Financial Services Committee Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. -- who has repeatedly called for Trump&apos;s impeachment and whom, in turn, Trump has called a \"low-IQ individual\" -- is one of the best-known Democrats who could soon wield the power of the committee gavel, and with it, the potential to subpoena and control the fate of legislation before it comes to a floor vote.\nIf Democrats retake the lower chamber, Waters, 80, would likely be elevated to chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, where she currently serves as ranking member. The committee oversees the housing, banking, insurance, and securities industries, and in the past year, Waters has offered some clues about her regulatory agenda.\nLast August, Waters moved unsuccessfully to subpoena Deutsche Bank AG for records concerning \"internal reviews of the personal accounts of the President and his family,\" as well as more information about fees levied against the bank concerning lax money-laundering detection policies that could have allowed Russian operatives to funnel cash without a paper trail.\nVideo And in May, Waters opposed a contested bill, which was ultimately backed by several other blue-state Democrats and signed into law by Trump, that rolled back some 2010 Obama-era Dodd-Frank regulations on virtually all of the nation&apos;s banks. (The 2010 legislation also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is facing a potential Supreme Court challenge for affording its director unilateral czar-like authorities; Trump has dulled the CFPB&apos;s influence, and now-Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh has previously ruled that the CFPB&apos;s structure is unconstitutional.)\nThe rollback of the Dodd-Frank package was supported by Hillary Clinton&apos;s former running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., as well as another Virginia Democrat, Mark Warner, who sponsored the 2010 legislation.\nWATERS ENCOURAGES SUPPORTERS TO &apos;PUSH BACK&apos; ON TRUMP STAFFERS IN PUBLIC, SAYS PEOPLE WILL &apos;ABSOLUTELY HARASS&apos; THEM\nWaters&apos; aggressive tack appears to have alarmed the financial industry. According to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, corporations, individuals, and affiliated entities within the securities and investment industry have spent more than $56.8 million to support Democratic candidates for Congress this election cycle, compared to only $33.4 million for Republicans. But a large portion of that money was going to moderate Democrats, not more left-leaning firebrands like Waters -- a sign that the industry may feel a Democratic takeover of the House is inevitable, and that supporting more temperate liberal candidates might be the safest bet.\nVideo LIZ PEEK: DEM HOUSE TAKEOVER WOULD ONLY DEEPEN PARTISAN DIVIDE, WITH &apos;JUST WIN, BABY&apos; ATTITUDE\nOn Wednesday, Fox Business Network&apos;s Charles Gasparino exclusively reported that people close to Waters say she would have a \"constructive relationship\" with banks and would prioritize her focus instead on the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is currently run by Ben Carson.\nAdam Schiff - Intelligence Committee Another top California Democratic representative, Adam Schiff, would likely rise to chair the House Intelligence Committee, where he is now the ranking member.\nSchiff, 58, said in an interview with CNN last week that Russia-related matters would be front-and-center as soon as he became the committee&apos;s helmsman. In particular, he has suggested he would parallel Waters&apos; focus on potential money-laundering schemes involving the Trump team and Russia, because he said he was unsure whether Special Counsel Robert Mueller had the legal mandate to pursue those leads.\n\"The question, though, that I don&apos;t know whether Mueller has been able to answer -- because I don&apos;t know whether he&apos;s been given the license to look into it -- is were the Russians laundering money through the Trump Organization?\" Schiff said. \"And that will be a very high priority to get an answer to -- for the reason that, if they were doing this, it&apos;s not only a crime, but it&apos;s something provable.\"\nVideo Mueller is authorized to probe \"any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated\" with Trump&apos;s team, as well as \"any matters that arose or may arise directly\" during the investigation.\n\"We will be able to get answers the Republicans were unwilling to pursue -- records that the Republicans wouldn&apos;t ask for,\" Schiff added.\nIn April, Republicans on the Intelligence Committee said they had found “no evidence” of any unlawful collusion between the Russian government and Trump campaign, and in September, the committee voted unanimously to release transcripts from that investigation.\nThere are indications Schiff wouldn&apos;t hesitate to push aggressively for more testimony and documents. In a tense closed-door session earlier this year, Schiff demanded contempt charges against former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon after he repeatedly asserted executive privilege and refused to answer questions related to the administration&apos;s interactions with Russia.\nFORMER TRUMP AIDE CARTER PAGE SUES DNC FOR DEFAMATION AFTER HE&apos;S ACCUSED OF RUSSIA TIES\nJerry Nadler - Judiciary Committee Schiff would be aided by New York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, who is currently the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee -- the committee that would oversee any attempt to impeach Trump.\nThe 71-year-old congressman was on the Judiciary Committee when it voted to impeach former President Bill Clinton, which Nadler said at the time was tantamount to an attempted coup and a gross abuse of the impeachment power. In September, Nadler said at a forum that \"impeachment should not be partisan,\" and he insisted that even some criminal offenses would not merit impeachment unless they implicate the institutions of government.\n\"If the president perjured himself about colluding with Russians, that would be worthy of impeachment,\" Nadler said. \"Perjury about some real estate deal that happened 10 years ago that the Trump Organization took, that would not be an impeachable offense. It would be a crime.\"\nNadler has made Trump&apos;s immigration policies one of his foremost priorities this year, especially in the wake of the administration&apos;s zero-tolerance policy on prosecuting illegal immigrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. That policy led to the separations of some children from their parents, causing an intense public backlash that prompted Trump to issue an executive order to end the separations.\nU.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., spoke to protesters and reporters after touring an immigration detention facility in New Jersey on Father's Day. (Rep. Jerry Nadler, via Twitter)\nNadler would have the authority as Judiciary Committee chairman to demand documents related to that episode, as well as the administration&apos;s crackdown on what it has called fraudulent asylum claims . Nadler was one of seven Democratic lawmakers who gained entry to an immigration detention center in New Jersey this summer after \"arguing\" with the police and \"literally banging on the door,\" one of the congressmen posted on Twitter.\nAt one point, Nadler declared that he was apparently making forcible entry to the facility: \"We have gotten the door open at the Elizabeth, NJ ICE detention center and refusing to let it close until we are given access to the detainees,\" he tweeted.\nSeparately, Nadler has vowed that the Judiciary Committee would take a closer look at the Senate testimony of Kavanaugh. Then a nominee to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh strenuously denied sexually assaulting anyone, and he insisted that he had never gotten so drunk that he had blacked out.\nLawmakers \"would have to investigate any credible allegations ... of perjury and other things that haven’t been properly looked into before,\" Nadler told ABC News last month.\nElijah Cummings - Oversight Committee Another key Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., is poised to become chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which has sweeping investigative jurisdiction and is considered one of the most influential committees in all of Congress. As chairman, Cummings would effectively have unilateral authority to issue subpoenas.\nHe has promised to probe how former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Scott Pruitt kept his job for months despite mounting ethics scandals, as well as whether and how Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner used a private email account to conduct official government business.\nRep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April accusing the Justice Department of using political bias when hiring immigration judges. (AP)\nCummings has also called for investigations into Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai, and is expected to doggedly pursue former Trump officials like fired National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, who has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.\n“Let’s cut through the unnecessary BS and let’s get to the facts — and I do not want anybody wasting my time,\" Cummings told Politico in October. \"Nor do I want to waste the time of my committee members or my family members. And I damn sure don’t want to waste my time.”\n\"Let’s cut through the unnecessary BS and let’s get to the facts.\"\n— Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md. But former GOP Judiciary Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, who is now a Fox News contributor, told the magazine that Cummings shouldn&apos;t get his hopes up.\n“If [North Carolina Rep.] Mark Meadows and [Ohio Rep.] Jim Jordan can’t get documents out of the White House, I don’t know why Elijah Cummings and the Democrats think they’ll do any better,” Chaffetz said.\nAnd despite the potentially imminent shakeup of key House committees -- and dire warnings from Trump that Democrats would enact change \"quickly and violently\" if they seize power -- some conservative analysts took a more sanguine view.\n\"I don’t think that Democrats taking over the House would change much,\" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who previously directed the Congressional Budget Office and now serves as president of a conservative think tank, told Fox News. \"The only legislative initiative that appears to be at stake is tax reform 2.0. Other than that, the same things happen, with Democrats doing a lot more oversight.\"\nGregg Re is an editor for Fox News. Follow him on Twitter @gregg_re .",

      "text": "Washington (CNN) The Environmental Protection Agency has quietly signaled it may allow states to release more ozone air pollution, commonly known as smog, dirtying the air in those states and neighboring ones, but the agency did not review the health impact of such a move.\nThe Trump administration's position is outlined in a highly technical guidance memo about plans states must create and submit for EPA approval under the Clean Air Act's good neighbor requirements. It was sent in August to EPA regional offices and posted on the agency's website, but not announced to the public. More than 90% of world's children breathe toxic air, report says, as India prepares for most polluted season The memo introduces the idea of increasing the threshold for how much smog a state can dump on its neighbors -- known as cross-state pollution -- before taking action to reduce emissions. Under the Trump administration's new guidance, states that are currently finalizing their plans can consider adopting a looser standard than would have been allowed under the Obama administration. The new one part per billion standard means a state can emit 43% more pollution across state lines than before. Smog is a byproduct of air pollutants including greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. It can originate from sources including power plants, refineries and factories. Smog can reduce the ability of the lungs to function, and especially impacts children, people who are active outside, or those who have respiratory diseases. It is linked to breathing issues and conditions such as asthma. Read More The guidance memo is just the latest move by the Trump administration to loosen restrictions surrounding air pollution. The administration has moved towards replacing the Clean Power Plan, moved towards freezing vehicle emission standards, and pulled out of the international Paris climate agreement. The EPA also recently overhauled the committees of scientists who advise it on clean air. The Clean Air Act mandates that the EPA works to make sure smog from certain states doesn't jeopardize air quality in downwind states. If there's pollution above the threshold, then the states would need to reduce emissions to come into compliance. Maryland is an example of a state struggling with this issue. According to an estimate from the Maryland Department of the Environment, 70% of smog in Baltimore on bad ozone days comes from out-of-state cars, trucks and power plants. Maryland has asked the EPA for help curbing the smog coming from upwind states. The EPA has denied the request and Maryland has filed a suit asking for a judicial review of the EPA's decision. The Obama-era EPA supported a tighter 0.7 part per billion threshold for smog. The 0.7 part per billion cross-state threshold was rooted in a 2015 rule that tightened the standards to \"provide increased public health protection against health effects associated with long- and short-term exposures\" to smog. The new memo is influential, because it guides decision making, but is not legally binding. It is guidance, rather than a regulation, so it did not go through the rigorous review process used to craft new rules. That also leaves it vulnerable to being reviewed or overturned by courts or a future administration. EPA spokesman John Konkus disputed that the EPA was raising the pollution threshold. Instead, he said the agency is giving states the option to raise the threshold themselves through the memo. \"The memo identifies potential technical approaches that a state may wish to choose in drafting their implementation plans' approach to its good neighbor obligations,\" he said. Konkus also said that the memo has \"no health impacts,\" but the agency admits they have not yet performed any health-related analysis. Several public health advocates say EPA isn't playing it straight with the public. \"EPA is allowing more harmful air pollution to be sent from big polluters in one state to neighboring states, refusing to control the pollution, then lying about what is an obvious rollback,\" said John Walke, the director of clean air at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a former agency attorney during the Clinton administration. \"It's absurd to pretend this so-called 'guidance' doesn't change what's acceptable: the purpose of the rollback memo is to let upwind states pollute more and refuse to control harmful smog and soot they emit into neighboring states,\" he added. Kyla Bennett, science director at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, told CNN the agency is allowing some states, \"under the guise of 'flexibility' and cooperative federalism, to emit more pollution.\" \"With a flick of the pen, this EPA guidance condemns hundreds of unlucky downwinders to early deaths every year,\" Bennett said. The EPA memo claimed the nationwide overall pollution impact will likely be small -- the difference of 7 percentage points out of 100. Some parts of the country, such as Western states like Arizona, will see virtually no impact, the memo said. But other states, like Maryland and parts of Colorado, could see pollution levels spike. The agency argues major gains have been made in reducing this sort of pollution. From 2007 to 2017, nitrogen oxides emissions, the key precursor for ground-level ozone pollution, has dropped by more than 40% nationwide, the agency said. Bill Wehrum, a former energy industry attorney who fought to weaken air pollution rules, critics say, now oversees air pollution regulations at the EPA. The EPA under then-Administrator Scott Pruitt initially tried to delay implementation of the Obama-era air quality rule, but now the Trump administration has decided to defend it in court, and recently argued in a federal appeals court against fossil fuel interests and five states supporting those interests. It is not clear why the administration changed course.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nJuchitán, Mexico (CNN) At 27 days old, Rachel had already traveled 316 miles with the migrant caravan, mostly in her mother Yesenia's arms. The pair left Guatemala with Yesenia's husband, Ernesto, and their 4 and 6-year-old daughters. Ernesto had recently lost his job and Yesenia was unemployed, and they were afraid of not being able to provide basic necessities for their daughters. Although the couple admitted that it had been difficult to read the news that President Donald Trump would send troops to the border, they hoped to request asylum in the US and prayed that God would help the President understand the hardships they had lived through.\nAlice Driver Yesenia, who had delivered via C-section, was unable to carry anything except Rachel, and she and Rachel depended on the kindness of strangers to give them a ride while her husband walked long, hot miles each day pushing the other two girls in a stroller. Were Rachel, Yesenia and their family the \"bad thugs\" and \"gang members\" of the migrant caravan that Trump had warned of on Twitter? They were not -- in fact, they were representative of the roughly 3,500 migrants of the caravan, of which an estimated 2,300 are children, according to UNICEF. The truth about this migrant caravan is that it is made up of grandparents, parents and children, of individuals fleeing such a level of violence and poverty that they are ready, like Yesenia, to walk and hitchhike thousands of miles in hopes of finding a new life further north. The caravan, which had about 7,000 members when it began in San Pedro Sula, Honduras on October 12, continues to shrink. This is, in part, because, according to the United Nations refugee agency, around 1,500 migrants have requested asylum in Mexico, while others in the face of sickness or injury are sometimes forced to turn back. By the time the migrant caravan reaches the US-Mexico border, the numbers will likely drop further. Read More A group of women, including a mother and daughter, rest on the side of the road and share water en route to Juchitán, Oaxaca. As I interviewed members of the caravan while they moved from Niltepec, Mexico to Juchitán, Mexico, I met families with babies and young children, pregnant women, adolescents looking for work, and old men and women with severe, oozing blisters. Almost everyone was wearing flip flops, hardly the ideal footwear for terrorists, as the President had suggested , and not one of the people I met was from the Middle East, yet another claim made by Trump without any seeming evidence to back it up. Even he later admitted \"there's no proof\" to the claim. I observed residents of a working-class neighborhood in Juchitán, who despite living in homes with dirt floors in an informal settlement, organized to provide both food and showers to the migrants, who they called their brothers and sisters. They want to support the migrants if they choose to request asylum in Mexico, which some could do, or to go on to the US, where many migrants have at least some family members. The migrants were provided shelter in an old bus station, and community volunteers and aid organizations like the Red Cross handed out blankets, clothes and medicine. Isaac, 2, is traveling with his mother Paola, 22, and his brother Carlos, 3, from San Pedro Sula, Honduras. They have been walking with the migrant caravan since it began. That night, I met 4-month-old Esmerelda, who was nestled between her mother Kayla's legs. The two had walked from Santa Bárbara, Honduras, and along the way kind citizens had given Kayla diapers and milk for the baby. Kayla, like so many others in the caravan, wanted to escape extreme poverty and a country in which daughters like her own were often forced to quit elementary school to work and help support the family. Paola, 22, a single mother, had traveled from San Pedro Sula, Honduras with her sons age 2 and 3. She left Honduras because she wanted to be able to offer her sons a better life, one in which violent gangs like MS-13 were not a part of their daily reality. Her mother lived in Canada and she hoped to start a new life there. Lillian, a young mother wearing a hat to combat temperatures that hovered around 100 degrees during the day, was traveling with her 1-year-old son, Tiago, and her husband. As she stood on the side of the road with Tiago in her arms, she talked about her husband, a farmer, and how difficult his work had become due to water scarcity and extreme temperatures. Their family was among many migrants propelled to move by climate change. They had sold everything except her child's clothes to have money for the journey. They wanted to request asylum in the US, but their dream was to one day return to Tegucigalpa, Honduras and build a house. Lillian from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, is traveling with her son Tiago, 1, and she has worn flip flops, often the only shoes migrants can afford. As I stood in the old bus station surrounded by a sea of humanity that night, I saw kids playing with balloons, girls from plates heaped with beans and tortillas, babies sleeping soundly, community members handing out diapers, and volunteers setting up a viewing of the movie \"Coco\" powered by solar energy. I met a single mother and her four children who had fled the political unrest in Nicaragua, a country where over 300 people were killed in protesting the government's decision to cut pensions. When I met her, she was standing in the grass trying to brush her youngest daughter's hair. I also met a US pediatric doctor who had spent a week volunteering with the caravan, and who said that it was irresponsible for Trump to call members of the migrant caravan criminals. \"Don't treat them like criminals,\" he said. \"So much of the blame for this migration falls on the United States.\" For more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter .\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\nAlthough President Trump has suggested he may limit how many migrants can apply for asylum, according to US and international law, these migrants all have the right to request asylum at the US-Mexico border. Members of the migrant caravan, who have suffered more than most US citizens can imagine, must be given the opportunity to go through the legal process that will determine if they get to stay in the US. At heart, we have always been a nation of immigrants, a nation that has faith in our institutions and that has provided refuge to those fleeing extreme violence and poverty. Trump has tried to erode that faith and turn a hungry, tired mass of migrants with sunburned faces and bleeding feet into something to fear. Regardless of whether Trump actually sends 15,000 troops to the border, the migrants that I talked to said they would always be more afraid of hunger and death than of a president who disliked them based on the color of their skin.",

      "text": "Washington (CNN) The uncle of White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said Friday that the Central American migrants seeking asylum are just like his Jewish ancestors who fled Europe and came to the US as refugees before World War II.\n\"They are just like our family,\" David Glosser told CNN's Alisyn Camerota in an interview on \"New Day.\" \"We needed to come here. We needed to find someplace to go and those that couldn't suffered the consequences.\" Stephen Miller's uncle: 'I felt it was incumbent upon me to raise my voice' against administration's immigration policy President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that he'll sign an executive order \"next week\" aimed at restricting US asylum claims to legal ports of entry. The President has been warning of an \"invasion\" at the US border by the caravan of Central American migrants, who are still making their way through Mexico. He has sent US troops to the border and, without evidence, claimed that criminals and gang leaders are among the caravan travelers. \"We are getting no moral leadership from the President, who is happy to condemn these people who are like our family, like my family,\" Glosser told CNN. He argued that there's \"institutional, political racism sweeping across the country, focused on vilifying people that you don't know, people who really are just like us.\" Read More Glosser, a retired neuropsychologist, wrote an op-ed in August in which he called his nephew an \"immigration hypocrite\" and blasted Miller's central involvement in crafting the Trump administration's immigration policies . Glosser said that his family would not have survived World War II and the Holocaust if they did not have the opportunity to immigrate to the US as refugees back in the early 1900s, before the enactment of the 1924 Immigration Act that limited the entry of eastern and southern European immigrants.",

      "text": "(CNN) President Donald Trump is slamming the constitutionally protected provision of birthright citizenship as a \"crazy, lunatic policy\" in an incendiary endgame to the midterm election campaign, which could save the Senate but risks putting the House beyond reach.\nWith four days to go, Trump is riding the strategy on which he has effectively bet his presidency -- a refusal to broaden his coalition and incessant appeals to his base -- into its biggest test so far. Yet his approach risks alienating more moderate voters in tight House races. RELATED: Numbers to know about birthright citizenship In one example of his all-in play to his most loyal supporters, Trump issued a new attack on the 14th Amendment, which guarantees that even children born on US soil to undocumented immigrants are American citizens, at a rally Thursday night in Missouri. The President has dubiously argued he has the power to override the provision with an executive order. And a day after unveiling the most racist national political ad in a generation, Trump vowed tough restrictions on asylum and turned his attention to consolidating GOP power in a trip to Missouri to support one of his proteges, Josh Hawley, who is well placed to unseat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. Read More The President even said that the US troops he plans to dispatch to the border to address what he claims is a national crisis could turn their guns on members of a migrant group -- currently hundreds of miles away in Mexico -- if they threw rocks at the troops. \"Democrats want open borders and want to invite caravan after caravan into our country,\" Trump told the euphoric, fired-up crowd, which lapped up his fiery rhetoric on immigration and chanted \"Build that wall! Build that wall!\" in a display of the potency of the issue among the President's base. The unusually distinct races for the two chambers of Congress this year mean that a scorched earth message that works well in Senate races in Trump country may backfire in House contests in more moderate territory. But in the final days of the campaign, the President has escalated rhetorical assaults on undocumented immigrants and the traveling migrant group to new heights, delighting base voters but infuriating Republicans in swing districts and GOP strategists worried about the House. That, and a travel schedule that appears to be mostly geared to getting red state Senate candidates over the line and toppling vulnerable Democrats, suggests the President can read the polls just as well as anyone else. Most pundits are staying away from predictions after Trump's shock win over Hillary Clinton in 2016. But a majority of models suggest the most likely outcome on Tuesday is that Democrats take the House and Republicans keep control of the Senate or even increase their majority by a couple of seats. CNN's Harry Enten assesses in his forecast that Democrats will win 225 seats -- and the House majority -- while Republicans will fall to 210 seats. A Democratic win of 202 seats or 262 seats is within the margin of error. Republicans will hold 52 seats -- and keep the majority -- in the Senate, while Democrats will hold just 48, according to Enten's analysis. Anything between Republicans holding 48 seats and 56 seats is within the margin of error. Using presidential symbolism to sell a campaign message Trump has been flinging flaming campaign trail attacks on immigration for days. But on Thursday he chose the ornate surroundings of the Roosevelt Room of the White House, often the venue for solemn state announcements, for what was billed as a major policy announcement on asylum. Yet what followed was a meandering speech , packed with misrepresentations and falsehoods, that lacked the big new plan that White House officials had promised -- other than a vague undertaking to issue an executive order next week. It was the latest indication that Trump's improvisational and politically motivated pronouncements often have his policy team struggling to catch up. The same thing happened when the President suddenly pledged last month to unveil a middle-class tax cut in the next few weeks -- even though Congress, which has the power of the purse -- was not in session at the time. The White House has since signaled there will be no movement on tax cuts until January at the earliest. In place of a major new policy proposal on asylum, the President cranked up the demagoguery, suggesting US troops could actually open fire on members of a migrant group if they ever reach the border. \"They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back,\" Trump said. \"When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say consider it a rifle,\" he said, setting out a scenario that is unlikely to come to pass and one of disproportionate force. His warning alarmed former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel, who served as secretary of defense in the Obama administration. \"My reaction ... is one of disgust. That is a wanton incitement of unnecessary violence. It is a distraction, It is a distortion, it is a rank political purpose to use our military like this,\" Hagel told CNN's Jake Tapper. \"Not in my lifetime have I ever heard those kind of words from a President of the United States.\" JUST WATCHED Hagel: Trump is using our troops as pawns Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nHagel: Trump is using our troops as pawns 03:16 Trump also said the military was building tent cities for detained migrants, when military officials have said no such construction is underway. He also falsely claimed that his administration has started building his famed border wall, taking credit for an existing project by the federal government to replace one section of fence with a wall. His latest escalation followed his tweet promoting a campaign video on Wednesday night that effectively equated the Central Americans in the traveling migrant group with a convicted murderer who killed two California deputies. Hardcore message undercuts Republicans in tight House battles The President's incessant, incendiary focus on immigration is frustrating some of his fellow Republicans, who have the fate of the House, especially, in mind. Rep. Ryan Costello, a moderate from Pennsylvania who is retiring after the election, warned that Trump's message could be the last straw for endangered GOP House members. \"I think closing on doom and gloom and scaring people over immigration, that is not going to bring home undecided voters in swing districts,\" Costello told CNN's Lauren Fox. \"I can't imagine anybody in a close district wants the closing argument to be immigration,\" Costello said. \"Your local message is in competition with what the President is talking about.\" Other Trump supporters are frustrated that the President is not talking exclusively about the economy , which grew at 3.5% in the third quarter, has taken the unemployment rate to a 50-year low of 3.7% and has promoted soaring business and consumer confidence. New jobless figures are expected to give Trump a further boost on Friday with the final release of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics before the election. But the President has clearly made a decision on the most profitable way to end his campaign -- and he has opted to be true to the populist, politically incorrect persona that won him the White House in the first place. It's possible the House was already out of reach, given his approval rating in the mid-40s, the fact that many vulnerable GOP lawmakers are running in districts that Clinton won and historical portents that suggest first-term presidents always struggle in the midterm elections. New polling from CNN suggests that in Trump country at least, his instincts for what his voters want are shrewd. Among likely Republican Senate voters in Florida, immigration is now an important issue for 33% of voters, up from 22% in mid-October, before he hit on his flaming midterm election closing argument.

      "text": "(CNN) President Donald Trump is slamming the constitutionally protected provision of birthright citizenship as a \"crazy, lunatic policy\" in an incendiary endgame to the midterm election campaign, which could save the Senate but risks putting the House beyond reach.\nWith four days to go, Trump is riding the strategy on which he has effectively bet his presidency -- a refusal to broaden his coalition and incessant appeals to his base -- into its biggest test so far. Yet his approach risks alienating more moderate voters in tight House races. RELATED: Numbers to know about birthright citizenship In one example of his all-in play to his most loyal supporters, Trump issued a new attack on the 14th Amendment, which guarantees that even children born on US soil to undocumented immigrants are American citizens, at a rally Thursday night in Missouri. The President has dubiously argued he has the power to override the provision with an executive order. And a day after unveiling the most racist national political ad in a generation, Trump vowed tough restrictions on asylum and turned his attention to consolidating GOP power in a trip to Missouri to support one of his proteges, Josh Hawley, who is well placed to unseat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. Read More The President even said that the US troops he plans to dispatch to the border to address what he claims is a national crisis could turn their guns on members of a migrant group -- currently hundreds of miles away in Mexico -- if they threw rocks at the troops. \"Democrats want open borders and want to invite caravan after caravan into our country,\" Trump told the euphoric, fired-up crowd, which lapped up his fiery rhetoric on immigration and chanted \"Build that wall! Build that wall!\" in a display of the potency of the issue among the President's base. The unusually distinct races for the two chambers of Congress this year mean that a scorched earth message that works well in Senate races in Trump country may backfire in House contests in more moderate territory. But in the final days of the campaign, the President has escalated rhetorical assaults on undocumented immigrants and the traveling migrant group to new heights, delighting base voters but infuriating Republicans in swing districts and GOP strategists worried about the House. That, and a travel schedule that appears to be mostly geared to getting red state Senate candidates over the line and toppling vulnerable Democrats, suggests the President can read the polls just as well as anyone else. Most pundits are staying away from predictions after Trump's shock win over Hillary Clinton in 2016. But a majority of models suggest the most likely outcome on Tuesday is that Democrats take the House and Republicans keep control of the Senate or even increase their majority by a couple of seats. CNN's Harry Enten assesses in his forecast that Democrats will win 225 seats -- and the House majority -- while Republicans will fall to 210 seats. A Democratic win of 202 seats or 262 seats is within the margin of error. Republicans will hold 52 seats -- and keep the majority -- in the Senate, while Democrats will hold just 48, according to Enten's analysis. Anything between Republicans holding 48 seats and 56 seats is within the margin of error. Using presidential symbolism to sell a campaign message Trump has been flinging flaming campaign trail attacks on immigration for days. But on Thursday he chose the ornate surroundings of the Roosevelt Room of the White House, often the venue for solemn state announcements, for what was billed as a major policy announcement on asylum. Yet what followed was a meandering speech , packed with misrepresentations and falsehoods, that lacked the big new plan that White House officials had promised -- other than a vague undertaking to issue an executive order next week. It was the latest indication that Trump's improvisational and politically motivated pronouncements often have his policy team struggling to catch up. The same thing happened when the President suddenly pledged last month to unveil a middle-class tax cut in the next few weeks -- even though Congress, which has the power of the purse -- was not in session at the time. The White House has since signaled there will be no movement on tax cuts until January at the earliest. In place of a major new policy proposal on asylum, the President cranked up the demagoguery, suggesting US troops could actually open fire on members of a migrant group if they ever reach the border. \"They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back,\" Trump said. \"When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say consider it a rifle,\" he said, setting out a scenario that is unlikely to come to pass and one of disproportionate force. His warning alarmed former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel, who served as secretary of defense in the Obama administration. \"My reaction ... is one of disgust. That is a wanton incitement of unnecessary violence. It is a distraction, It is a distortion, it is a rank political purpose to use our military like this,\" Hagel told CNN's Jake Tapper. \"Not in my lifetime have I ever heard those kind of words from a President of the United States.\" JUST WATCHED Hagel: Trump is using our troops as pawns Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nHagel: Trump is using our troops as pawns 03:16 Trump also said the military was building tent cities for detained migrants, when military officials have said no such construction is underway. He also falsely claimed that his administration has started building his famed border wall, taking credit for an existing project by the federal government to replace one section of fence with a wall. His latest escalation followed his tweet promoting a campaign video on Wednesday night that effectively equated the Central Americans in the traveling migrant group with a convicted murderer who killed two California deputies. Hardcore message undercuts Republicans in tight House battles The President's incessant, incendiary focus on immigration is frustrating some of his fellow Republicans, who have the fate of the House, especially, in mind. Rep. Ryan Costello, a moderate from Pennsylvania who is retiring after the election, warned that Trump's message could be the last straw for endangered GOP House members. \"I think closing on doom and gloom and scaring people over immigration, that is not going to bring home undecided voters in swing districts,\" Costello told CNN's Lauren Fox. \"I can't imagine anybody in a close district wants the closing argument to be immigration,\" Costello said. \"Your local message is in competition with what the President is talking about.\" Other Trump supporters are frustrated that the President is not talking exclusively about the economy , which grew at 3.5% in the third quarter, has taken the unemployment rate to a 50-year low of 3.7% and has promoted soaring business and consumer confidence. New jobless figures are expected to give Trump a further boost on Friday with the final release of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics before the election. But the President has clearly made a decision on the most profitable way to end his campaign -- and he has opted to be true to the populist, politically incorrect persona that won him the White House in the first place. It's possible the House was already out of reach, given his approval rating in the mid-40s, the fact that many vulnerable GOP lawmakers are running in districts that Clinton won and historical portents that suggest first-term presidents always struggle in the midterm elections. New polling from CNN suggests that in Trump country at least, his instincts for what his voters want are shrewd. Among likely Republican Senate voters in Florida, immigration is now an important issue for 33% of voters, up from 22% in mid-October, before he hit on his flaming midterm election closing argument.",

      "text": "Washington (CNN Business) The US economy added 250,000 jobs in October, significantly exceeding expectations, the government announced Friday .\nThe unemployment rate remained at 3.7%, a 49-year low. Hispanic unemployment reached its lowest rate ever, at 4.4%. Wages grew 3.1%, relatively robust growth after years of stagnant paychecks. The numbers give President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans a positive talking point as they head into the midterm elections next Tuesday, even amidst turmoil on the major stock exchanges over the past few weeks. Trump, along with other top White House aides, cheered the report on Twitter Friday morning. Wow! The U.S. added 250,000 Jobs in October - and this was despite the hurricanes. Unemployment at 3.7%. Wages UP! These are incredible numbers. Keep it going, Vote Republican!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 2, 2018 Read More \"Clearly there's some concern in financial markets, but this report just tells you that the labor market is just shrugging that off for now,\" said Josh Wright, chief economist for the recruiting platform iCIMS. \"Even if some corporations are concerned about the medium-term outlook, in the very near term they're really focused on bringing in fresh talent to capitalize on the economy for as long as it lasts.\" Although voters see the economy as one of the top issues that will determine who they favor for in the midterm elections, according to Pew Research , analyses of past midterms show that partisan views tend to overwhelm the objective performance of the labor market. The jobs news will almost certainly overwhelm another piece of economic news released Friday — the trade deficit in goods and services, which widened in September as imports rose more than exports. Year to date, the deficit is now 10.1% larger in 2018 than it was over the same period in 2017. The year-over-year percentage growth in average hourly earnings looks slightly larger than it actually is because wages declined last October as low-wage workers returned to their jobs following a particularly strong hurricane season. But economists said it's still encouraging, as the pay increase remains well above the inflation rate, meaning that workers' pay is actually raising their standard of living. Some of the strong payrolls growth came from a slight downward revision to September's number, but overall it lifts the average over the past 12 months to 211,000. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said last month that Hurricane Florence may have depressed job growth, but that Hurricane Michael in the Florida panhandle had \"no discernible effect.\" The continued pace of job growth is unusual at this point in an economic recovery, and shows that there are still enough workers coming off the sidelines as opportunities improve to supply at least a portion of businesses' labor needs. The civilian labor force participation rate for workers between ages 25 and 54, which measures the percentage of the population that is working or looking for work, jumped to its highest level since May 2010. Most of the net new jobs came from health care, construction, and manufacturing, which has added 296,000 jobs over the past year. Although the purchasing managers index for manufacturing fell in October to the lowest level since April, indicating slowing demand, the employment report is an an indication that tariffs on imported aluminum and steel haven't negatively impacted hiring in factories thus far. Retail hiring showed no growth on a seasonally adjusted basis. The strong numbers should reassure Federal Reserve officials that they're clear to keep raising interest rates, as they approach the \"neutral\" rate at which monetary policy is pressing neither the accelerator or the brake on economic growth. The question remains, however, whether the Fed will stop there — or keep hiking, in order to cool things down. Some advocates, such as the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, believe interest rates should remain relatively low until nominal wage growth reaches the 3.5% to 4% range at which inflation might start to rise more quickly.",

      "text": "Supreme Court Published 2 days ago Kavanaugh turns down nearly $600G raised online for his defense: reports By Louis Casiano | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email\nFILE - The Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Associated Press)\nSupreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has reportedly turned down nearly $600,000 that had been raised in his name after sexual misconduct allegations were leveled against him during his confirmation process.\nA GoFundMe page through which the funds were raised had a message saying Kavanaugh would not accept the money in order to avoid judicial ethics violations, the Washington Examiner reported .\n“I&apos;ve spoken to a former clerk for Judge Kavanaugh who told me that Kavanaugh’s supporters loved the outpouring of support from this GoFundMe,\" said conservative blogger John Hawkins, who launched the page Sept. 24. \"Judicial ethics rules caution judges against permitting the use of the prestige of judicial office for fund-raising purposes. Justice Kavanaugh will not accept any proceeds from the campaign, nor will he direct that any proceeds from the campaign be provided to any third party.\"\nThe page launched one day after the New Yorker published allegations from Deborah Ramirez, who claimed Kavanaugh exposed himself to her while they were in college, and a week after Christine Blasey Ford accused him of trying to force himself on her, also decades ago.\nVideo Hawkins said he received a statement from the law clerk several days ago saying Kavanaugh was not able to accept the money and said Kavanaugh requested that Hawkins discontinue the use of his name for any fund-raising purposes.\nInstead, Hawkins said he will donate the money to the Archdiocese of Washington, which operates the Catholic Youth Organization where Kavanaugh used to coach a girls’ basketball team.\nThe page is no longer accepting donations.\nIn an interview with Yahoo! , Hawkins said the idea for a Kavanaugh fundraiser page came from a conversation with a woman who noticed all the pages that had been launched on behalf of Ford.\n“I was talking to a woman and … she was like, ‘Christine Blasey Ford has these GoFundMes up; I wish someone would do a GoFundMe for Brett Kavanaugh,\" Hawkins said.\nPresident Trump nominated Kavanaugh for the nation&apos;s highest court in July, after Justice Anthony Kennedy announced plans to retire from his lifetime appointment. After a contentious confirmation process, the U.S. Senate voted to 50-48 on Oct. 6 to confirm Kavanaugh&apos;s nomination.",

      "title": "The 14th Amendment: What it says about birthright citizenship - CNN",
      "text": "(CNN) It may not be as oft-quoted as the First Amendment or as contested as the Second Amendment, but the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution plays a critical role in supporting some of our closest-held notions of American freedom and equality.\nFor one, it clearly states that American citizenship is a birthright for all people who are born on American soil -- something that President Donald Trump has announced he wants to end . Not only would this unravel 150 years of American law, it would loosen a significant cornerstone of the Constitution's interpretation of American identity. In order to better understand this part of the 14th Amendment, we asked two experts in constitutional and immigration law to walk us through the first section. The amendment has five sections, but we will only be dealing with the first, which contains the Citizenship Clause and three other related clauses. But first, some history The 14th Amendment is known as a Reconstruction amendment, because it was added to the Constitution after the Civil War in 1868. That places it at an important historical crossroads, when lingering wounds of divisiveness and animosity still plagued the nation and the reality of a post-slavery America begged contentious racial and social questions. Read More \"Thomas Jefferson said men were created equal, but the original Constitution betrayed that promise by allowing for slavery,\" says Jeffrey Rosen. \"The 13th, 14th and 15th amendments were designed to enshrine Lincoln's promise of a new America.\" However, as so often is the case, this reaffirmed American ideal fell short of reality. Rosen notes that issues of civil rights and equal treatment continued to be denied to African Americans, LGBT people and other citizens for more than a century after the amendment's ratification. And Erika Lee points out that Native Americans weren't even allowed to become citizens until 1925. \"Even as [these amendments] were written, obviously there were major built-in inequalities and maybe at the time weren't intended to apply to everyone,\" Lee says. Why was citizenship by birthright such an important concept? \"Citizenship was a central question left open by the original Constitution,\" says Rosen. \"At the time it was written, the Constitution assumed citizenship, but it didn't provide any rules for it. In the infamous Dred Scott decision, the Chief Justice said African Americans can't be citizens of the US and 'had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.'\" The US Supreme Court's ruling in the Dred Scott case, named for a slave who unsuccessfully sued for his freedom, has since been widely condemned. READ MORE: Scott v. Sandford \"The 14th Amendment was designed to overturn this decision and define citizenship once and for all, and it was based on birthright,\" Rosen says. \"It is really important that it's a vision of citizenship based on land rather than blood. It is an idea that anyone can be an American if they commit themselves to our Constitutional values.\" What does it mean to be \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof?\" According to Rosen, this is one of the greatest questions of citizenship. There are two clear examples of people not subject to the jurisdictions of the United States: diplomats and their children, and -- at the time of the 14th Amendment -- Native Americans, who were not recognized as part of the American populace. \"With those two exceptions, everyone who was physically present in the United States was thought to be under its jurisdiction,\" Rosen says. \"There are numerous Supreme Court cases that reaffirm that understanding, and almost as importantly, there are lots of congressional statutes that assume birthright citizenship.\" Some scholars, like John Eastman of the Claremont Institute's Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence , have argued that children of undocumented immigrants are not \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the US and thus should not be considered citizens under the Constitution. But Rosen says this is a minority view among constitutional scholars of all political backgrounds. \"While the Supreme Court has not explicitly ruled [on the issue of children of undocumented immigrants], Congress has passed all kinds of laws presuming their citizenship,\" Rosen says. What is the connection between birthright citizenship and immigration? In 1898, 30 years after the 14th Amendment was adopted, the Supreme Court reached a defining decision in a case known as the United States v. Wong Kim Ark. Lee explains that Wong Kim Ark was the American-born son of Chinese immigrants. \"Asian immigrants were the first immigrants to the US that couldn't be considered white,\" Lee says. \"So they are treated differently. They are taxed differently, they are stripped of many rights. In the 1880s, they are excluded from immigration and barred from citizenship.\" READ MORE: The United States v. Wong Kim Ark So, the main question of the case was, could a person born in America be a citizen in a place where his parents could not be as well? The Supreme Court decided yes, and the case remains the first defining legal decision made under the banner of birthright citizenship. \"[The Supreme Court's decision] said that the right of citizenship is not a matter of inheritance, that it never descends from generation to generation, it is related to where you're born,\" Lee says. \"It's about the power of place. That has been a very expansive, and at the time, a corrective measure to a more exclusionary definition both legally as well as culturally as to what an American is.\" Why must it be stated that the privileges of citizenship need to be protected? Before the Civil War, states didn't necessarily have to follow the provisions stated in the Bill of Rights; only Congress had to. The 14th Amendment changed that. \"This second sentence of the Amendment means that states have to respect the Bill of Rights as well as basic civil rights and the rights that come along with citizenship,\" Rosen says. \"The idea was that there were rights that were so basic; so integral to citizenship that they could not be narrowed by the states.\" Despite the promises and protections of citizenship, Lee says it is abundantly clear that different racial groups were, and often are, seen as unable or unworthy to function as true American citizens. After all, basic rights of citizenship, like suffrage and equal treatment, were denied certain racial groups for a hundred years after the 14th Amendment. \"The idea of a law applying to 'all people' seems to be clear. But in reality, the debate and the laws and practices that get established are very much based on a hierarchy of, well sure, all persons, but some are more fit and some are more deserving than others,\" she says. Throughout history, Asian immigrants, Mexican immigrants, Muslim immigrants and their children, to name a few, have had unspoken cultural caveats applied to their ability to be Americans. \"For Asian immigrants, the racial argument at the time was that 'It didn't matter whether one were born in the US or not, Asians as a race, are unassimilable. They are diametrically opposite from us Americans,'\" Lee says. \"That was the argument that was used to intern Japanese citizens. It was the denial of citizenship in favor of race: 'The ability to become American, the ability to assimilate, they just didn't have it.'\" Why was it important to legalize rights for non-citizens? So far, we've covered the first clause, the Citizenship Clause, and the second, the Privileges and Immunities Clause. These both deal with American citizens. The final two clauses, the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection clause, are a little different, and deal with the rights of all people in the United States. Eagle-eyed Constitution readers will notice that the 14th Amendment contains a \"due process\" clause very similar to the Fifth Amendment. This, says Rosen, was a technical addition to ensure the Fifth Amendment wasn't theoretically narrowed down to protect only American citizens. \"The 14th Amendment distinguishes between the privileges of citizenship and the privileges of all people,\" Rosen says. \"The framers [of the amendment] thought there were certain rights that were so important that they should be extended to all persons, and in order to specify that they needed a new 'due process' clause.\" What does it mean to have 'equal protection of the laws'? \"At the time following the Civil War, at its core, it meant all persons had the right to be protected by the police, that the laws of the country should protect all people,\" Rosen says. \"In the 20th century, more broader questions were litigated under the 14th Amendment, like Brown v. Board of Education -- whether segregation was constitutional. Cases involving the internment of Japanese citizens, case from the marriage equality decisions, even Roe vs. Wade have strains of equal protection language and invoke due process law.\" READ MORE: Brown v. Board of Education Another interesting case that speaks directly to the immigration side of the 14th Amendment debate is the 1982 case of Plyler v. Doe, in which the Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional for the state of Texas to deny funding for undocumented immigrant children. READ MORE: Plyler v. Doe Why are we talking about all this right now? This week, Trump vowed to end the right to citizenship for the children of non-citizens and unauthorized immigrants born on US soil. But his interest in repealing birthright citizenship isn't a new idea. Lee says for the last 30 years or so, there have been several overtures by the political right to explore \"citizenship reform,\" a timeline that she says aligns with the ascendancy of modern American conservatism. Lee fears if the current push to end birthright citizenship is successful, it could have wider implications than most people assume. People from other countries who are here legally on work or student visas, for instance, could have children who do not legally belong to the only country they know. \"There have been attempts since the 1990s to break away birthright citizenship, or narrow it down, and it did not seem that they would have a chance at succeeding until now,\" she says. \"To me this not only reflects the ascendancy of an extreme right position but also a return to a very narrow and exclusionary definition of Americanness.\" READ: Birthright citizenship: Trump claims only the US grants it, he's wrong UPDATE: This article has been updated to conform with CNN's editorial style on the term \"undocumented immigrant.\"",

      "text": "Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) The body of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was dismembered after he was strangled as soon as he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the chief prosecutor's office in Istanbul said Wednesday.\nThis was carried out as part of a premeditated plan, according to a statement by the chief prosecutor's office. The statement is the clearest yet from the Turkish authorities about the fate of the Washington Post journalist, whose remains have not yet been found. \"The victim's body was dismembered and destroyed following his death by suffocation,\" the statement said. Khashoggi fiancée: Trump should 'not pave the way for a cover-up' \"In accordance with plans made in advance, the victim Jamal Khashoggi, was choked to death immediately after entering the Consulate General of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul on October 2, 2018.\" Read More Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday demanded that Saudi Arabia reveal the location of Khashoggi's body and hand over 18 suspects . The Saudis have presented shifting stories about Khashoggi's fate, initially denying any knowledge before arguing that a group of rogue operators, many of whom belong to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's inner circle, were responsible for Khashoggi's death. The Saudi attorney general then acknowledged that Khashoggi was killed in a premeditated murder . Turkish investigators continue to look for clues to the whereabouts of his body. Security camera footage shows Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate on October 2. A source close to the Saudi Royal Palace told CNN last week that the location of Khashoggi's body was not known to the Saudis. The source said the body was handed over to a local \"collaborator\" after the killing, adding that it is not at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. \"We have requested information from Saudi officials regarding the whereabouts of Jamal Khashoggi's body and the identity of the supposed local collaborator. We also noted that Saudi Arabia must extradite all 18 suspects to Turkey so that they can be held accountable for what they did,\" a senior Turkish official told CNN on Wednesday. Only Donald Trump can end the Jamal Khashoggi standoff \"The Saudi officials seemed primarily interested in finding out what evidence the Turkish authorities had against the perpetrators. In other words, we did not get the impression that they were keen on genuinely cooperating with the investigation,\" the official said. The Saudi chief prosecutor arrived in Turkey on Sunday to meet with his Turkish counterpart. Turkish state news agency Anadolu reported that he had boarded a plane back to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, having met with the Istanbul chief prosecutor twice. The chief prosecutor's office in Istanbul said that during those meetings, Turkey and Saudi Arabia had \"agreed to investigate, search and uncover all details of the event from all angles and to bring those who carried out and planned it to ... justice.\" But, the statement said, the Saudis had not answered three questions the Turkish side posed -- namely, where Khashoggi's body is; whether Saudi investigators had uncovered evidence about the planning of his killing; and the identity of the reported \"local collaborator.\" Instead, it said, the Saudis on Wednesday invited the Turkish prosecutor and his delegation to Saudi Arabia jointly to question the suspects held there about what happened to Khashoggi's body and whether his death was premeditated. The Turks added that the Saudi prosecutor also said no statement had been made by Saudi authorities about the existence of the purported local cooperator. Can Saudi Arabia win back its global business partners? 'Time will tell' \"Despite our well-intentioned efforts to reveal the truth, no concrete results have come out of those meetings,\" the Istanbul chief prosecutor's office said, adding that it was in this light that it had been \"obliged\" to share the details about how Khashoggi was strangled and his body \"dismembered and destroyed,\" in accordance with plans made in advance. The Saudi government has said it will carry out a thorough and transparent investigation and that the suspects will be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia. After Saudi Arabia admitted that Khashoggi was killed in its Istanbul consulate, five high-ranking officials were dismissed, including bin Salman's media chief and the deputy head of the Saudi intelligence service. Eighteen people were arrested. Riyadh has maintained that neither bin Salman nor King Salman knew of the operation to target Khashoggi. US officials have said such a mission -- including 15 men sent from Riyadh -- could not have been carried out without the authorization of bin Salman, the country's de facto ruler.",

And these are very difficult times, and this has been a very difficult problem,\" Bennett said on \"The Story\" Thursday.\nHe noted that under the current system, illegal immigrants who apply for asylum -- even if their claims are fraudulent -- have been allowed into the U.S. pending the adjudication of their claims.\n\"People touch the ground, they are released, and then 600,000 or 800,000 people are wandering around the United States. They never come back for a hearing,\" Bennett said.\nHe said this is an issue Congress has failed to resolve, and the president is \"absolutely right\" to address it.\n\"People are saying he's too tough. Well, sometimes you need Mother Teresa, sometimes you need Dirty Harry.\"\nWatch more from \"The Story\" above.",

      "text": "(CNN) \"When I can, I tell the truth.\"\nThat's the President of the United States trying to explain his very casual relationship to truth to ABC News' White House reporter Jon Karl. It's a statement that, like many things Trump says, is unintentionally revealing about what he considers facts and how much commitment he feels to ensure he is speaking the truth when communicating information to the public. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\nThe reality is this: Trump tells the truth -- defined as an agreed upon fact or facts -- when it works for him. When established facts back up something Trump either innately believes to be true or something he wants to be true for political reasons, he is more than happy to tell the truth. But when the facts don't back up a Trump view or claim, he has zero compunction in creating his own \"truth\" that works better for his purposes. Here's his full answer to Karl, which gives you an even better sense of what Trump thinks about truth: \"Well, I try. I do try ... and I always want to tell the truth. When I can, I tell the truth. And sometimes it turns out to be where something happens that's different or there's a change, but I always like to be truthful.\" Read More The key to that answer is the seven words I cited above. But the rest is interesting too! Trump wants Karl to know that he does \"want to tell the truth\" and he gives it the old college \"try.\" But he gives up the game when he seeks to explain why and when he isn't truthful. \"Sometimes it turns out to be where something happens that's different or there's a change,\" Trump tells Karl. Go back and read that last sentence again. I dare you to figure out what Trump is even trying to say. As best I can tell, he seems to suggest that the facts change sometimes -- and so when he cites facts and they do change, he can't really be held responsible for that, now can he? Like what you're reading? Check out the latest analysis from The Point with Chris Cillizza :\nWhere Donald Trump is going in the last week of the 2018 campaign -- and why Sarah Sanders can't name a single 'fake news' outlet The definitive ranking of 2020 Democrats This week in politics, GIF'd\nThat argument is undermined by Trump's track record, as expertly documented by The Washington Post's Fact Checker blog . Yes, the Fact Checker found that Trump said more than 5,000 false or misleading claims in his first 601 days in office -- a rate of more than eight a day. But even more importantly for this, the Fact Checker points out that Trump repeats falsehoods dozens of times -- even after facts repute that claim. For example, Trump has claimed the US economy is the greatest in American history more than 50 times. Trump has said the Russia investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller is a witch hunt or a hoax more than 140 times. Looking at numbers like those, it's impossible to accept at face value Trump's claim that he does his best to tell the truth but sometimes circumstances just change and what he has said is the truth winds up being something short of that. What those numbers prove -- or, if you've been paying attention, affirm -- is that Trump is simply telling himself a story about his life, the presidency and the country that, more often than not, doesn't track with established facts. And not only that, but also that Trump doesn't much care whether or not what he is saying is true. He cares that it is believed by his supporters. Their applause, their chants of \"Lock her up,\" their boos when he mentions the so-called \"fake news\" media -- all of that is the affirmation, in Trump's mind, that what he is doing is right. Because he needs to be believed -- even when established facts make clear he is lying -- Trump has become increasingly willing to tell his supporters that everything that they are told from anyone other than him is to be dismissed as more fake news. \"Stick with us,\" he told a VFW crowd in Kansas City back in July. \"Don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. ... What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening.\" What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening. Think about that statement for a minute. The President of the United States is telling people that their eyes and ears aren't to be trusted. That the only person they should believe -- up to and including themselves -- is him. Now consider what we know: That Trump has very little concern for whether the things he says are actually, you know, true. Add it all up and you get this: We have people taking their marching orders from a deeply unreliable source. A source who happens to also be the President of the United States.",

      "text": "ND Senate hopeful Cramer addresses criticism from farmers North Dakota Republican Senate candidate Kevin Cramer supports President Trump's trade policies. The North Dakota Democratic Party is discouraging hunters from voting in the upcoming election, claiming they could lose their out-of-state hunting licenses if they do so. “Attention hunters: If you vote in North Dakota, you may forfeit hunting licenses you have in other states. If you want to keep your out-of-state hunting licenses, you may not want to vote in North Dakota,” the ad says, linking to a similar warning on the North Dakota Democratic-NPL website.\nThe North Dakota Democratic Party is under fire for purchasing an advertisement warning hunters they could lose their out-of-state hunting licenses if they vote in the upcoming election. (Facebook/screenshot)\n“By voting in North Dakota, you could forfeit your hunting licenses. You MUST be a resident of North Dakota to vote here. And if you are a resident of North Dakota, you may lose hunting licenses you have in other states,” the website said.\nThe ad is linked to the Hunter Alert Facebook page which appears to have been created earlier this week. Facebook notes it was paid for by the North Dakota Democratic-NPL.\nFOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTION HEADQUARTERS\nA spokesman for the North Dakota Game and Fish Department said it was not involved in the ad and didn't back the message.\n“I don’t know what they’re talking about,” Robert Timian, the chief game warden, told Fox News.\nHe said he wasn’t aware of any similar ads in the past.\nNorth Dakota Secretary of State Al Jaeger also told political blogger Rob Port he’s never heard such a claim before.\nNorth Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, is in danger of losing her seat to Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer in next week’s election. Fox News has ranked the race as likely Republican.\nHEITKAMP APOLOGIZES FOR NAMING SEXUAL ASSAULT, ABUSE VICTIMS IN NEWSPAPER AD\nLast week, Heitkamp gave almost $2.7 million of her campaign cash to the North Dakota Democratic Party to help with other races in the state.\n“Heidi Heitkamp is using her anti-Kavanaugh campaign coffers to suppress voter turnout in North Dakota,” Jake Wilkins, the North Dakota GOP spokesman, told Fox News, adding she’s “made it clear that she only cares about winning re-election, not helping her constituents.”\nDonald Trump Jr., the president’s oldest son, accused the party of trying to suppress voters.\n“Only the party that wants to take your guns could do something so untruthful to suppress the North Dakota vote. This ad is false,” he said. “Don’t let these liar Democrats get away with it.”\nRepublicans, too, have been accused of voter suppression ahead of the election. A new law requires North Dakotans to have an ID that shows a name, birthdate and street address to vote. But many Native Americans, who tend to vote for Democrats , say a street address is not always evident on reservations.\nA federal judge denied a request from a North Dakota tribe to block the state’s voter ID law earlier this week.\nNeither Heitkamp’s campaign nor the Democratic Party responded to a request for comment from Fox News Friday morning.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

      "text": "Atlanta (CNN) Media icon Oprah Winfrey will hit the campaign trail this week for Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.\nWinfrey will participate in two town hall events with Abrams -- one in Marietta and one in Decatur -- on Thursday to aide her campaign in what has become a highly competitive, closely watched race. \"Oprah Winfrey has inspired so many of us through the years with her unparalleled ability to form real connections and strengthen the bonds of family and community,\" Abrams said in a statement Wednesday. \"I am honored to have Oprah join me for uplifting and honest conversations with voters about the clear choice before us in this election and the boundless potential of Georgians.\" It's a rare political endorsement for Winfrey, who backed former President Barack Obama during the primaries in 2008 and lent her support to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. On Tuesday, she appeared in a video with NBC News' Maria Shiver to urge people to vote, saying she's a political independent before adding, \"people think I'm a Democrat.\" If elected, Abrams would be the first black woman governor in any US state. Read More The Georgia gubernatorial race has drawn national attention and high-profile politicians to the Peach State. Former President Barack Obama will hold a rally for Abrams on Friday at Morehouse College in Atlanta, and other prominent Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, have also traveled to the state to bolster Abrams' chances of winning. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, meanwhile, have also announced visits to support Abrams' Republican challenger, Brian Kemp, in the remaining days of the campaign. Winfrey invited questions about her own political ambition earlier this year when she said at the Golden Globes that \"a new day is on the horizon.\" She later told Vogue , however, that she wouldn't be able to stomach a presidential run. \"I would not be able to do it. It's not a clean business. It would kill me.\"",

      "text": "(CNN) Lines snaked around the block outside immigration courts across the United States on Wednesday. But many people standing in them later learned they had no reason to be there.\nMore than 100 immigrants showed up to court carrying paperwork ordering them to appear before a judge, only to find out that their court dates hadn't actually been scheduled, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA). And as a result, uncharacteristically long lines were reported outside at least 10 immigration courts, the association said. Lawyers told CNN it's part of a troubling trend that shows how dysfunctional the system has become and how chaotic the Trump administration's approach to immigration enforcement can be. \"From a humanitarian point of view, it's sickening what you're seeing happening here, because they're toying with these individuals' lives in many cases. ... This is widespread, it's national and it's outrageous,\" said Jeremy McKinney, AILA's treasurer and an immigration attorney in North Carolina. Sessions criticizes immigrants' attorneys before immigration judges Attorneys say the practice began after the US Supreme Court ruled in June that notices to appear -- the charging documents that immigration authorities issue to send someone to immigration court who's accused of being in the United States illegally -- must specify the time and place of proceedings in order to be valid. Read More Since then, immigration lawyers across the country have reported that officials are increasingly issuing such notices with so-called \"fake dates,\" ordering immigrants to appear at hearings that, it later turns out, were never scheduled in immigration courts. In recent months, lawyers have reported examples of notices issued for nonexistent dates, such as September 31st, and for times of day when courts aren't open, such as midnight. View note On Wednesday, US Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Daniel Hetlage said initial dates on notices issued by his agency and Immigration and Customs Enforcement are \"based on guidance on upcoming docket dates from local EOIR, an agency within the US Department of Justice responsible for administering the immigration courts.\" In a joint statement released Friday, the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice said the confusion was a result of \"minor logistical errors.\" \"The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are working through minor logistical errors that resulted in a number of individuals appearing for immigration court hearings that were not docketed in accordance with regulatory requirements,\" the statement said. \"These errors will be resolved and will not prevent these cases from being docketed properly in a timely fashion.\" Officials haven't responded to questions about why this occurred, how many people were affected and what steps they plan to take going forward. Notices issued for dates that don't exist, times when court is closed On Wednesday, reports of the so-called \"fake date\" practice were far more widespread than previously observed, and attorneys reported seeing larger numbers of people affected, said Laura Lynch, AILA's senior policy counsel. Attorneys observed long lines at courts in Baltimore, Charlotte, Atlanta, Orlando, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Phoenix and San Diego. Immigrants with \"fake dates\" were also seen at courts Wednesday in Las Vegas and Denver, Lynch said, but lines there weren't as long. In this screengrab from a handout video provided by the American Immigration Lawyers Association, people are seen lining up outside the Atlanta Immigration Court on October 31. \"The line was around the corner,\" said Jorge Gavilanes, an immigration attorney in Atlanta who witnessed the crowds gathering Wednesday. \"Security was unprepared for this. The court was unprepared for this. They were scrambling to check every single one of these cases to see if these cases have been already filed with this court.\" This isn't the first time such situations have been reported. The Dallas Morning News documented the practice occurring in court there in September . It may sound like a small bureaucratic glitch, Lynch said, but such mix-ups can take a significant toll on immigrants' lives. \"Clients are driving like eight hours and taking off of work in order to appear at these hearings, only to find out that it's not the actual correct hearing date. The impact is their jobs, it's their life, and also just the anxiety,\" she said. Attorney: 'People were obviously fearful' Sometimes, lawyers say they're able to confirm with courts beforehand that certain noticed hearing dates aren't accurate, but then struggle to convince their clients not to show up in court anyway. \"They're so anxious to cooperate. They don't want any problems with ICE or with the authorities,\" says Rachel Effron Sharma, an immigration attorney in Atlanta who tried to explain the situation to clients this week. \"They got a letter telling them to go that day. They didn't understand how it would be possible that there would be a date that was just made up.\" Two lawyers. One court. And their fight against the odds. Gavilanes said he's found himself in a similar predicament, trying to reassure clients who know that if they don't show up for a scheduled court hearing, the consequences could be severe. \"People were obviously fearful that if they miss their hearing, they were going to get deported in their absence, and they didn't want to take that chance,\" he said. \"They'd rather show up at the court and have them tell them go home instead of not showing up and worry(ing) about it.\" On Wednesday, Gavilanes said he fielded questions from numerous immigrants who were baffled by the situation. \"I don't think people really understand why this is happening,\" he said. This story has been updated to include a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice.",

      "title": "Carlos Curbelo: Racist Trump video is 'part of a divide and conquer strategy' - CNNPolitics",
      "text": "Washington (CNN) Moderate Republican lawmakers distanced themselves on Thursday from the racist video shared by President Donald Trump's campaign, with at least one House member saying the video is endangering vulnerable GOP candidates fighting to keep the party's House majority.\nThe video, which was tweeted by Trump six days before the midterm elections, accuses Democrats, without evidence, of plotting to help people it depicts as Central American invaders overrun the nation with cop killers. Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who has opposed parts of Trump's agenda in the past, told CNN's Jim Sciutto on \"Newsroom\" that the ad is politically divisive. \"It's definitely part of a divide and conquer strategy that a lot of politicians, including the President, have used successfully in the past,\" he told Sciutto. \"I hope this doesn't work. I hope that type of strategy starts failing in our country, but that's up to the American people.\" \"If we continue getting divided, if our politics continues growing more and more violent, our democracy is going to be at real risk,\" he added. Read More Trump shocks with racist new ad days before midterms Rep. Ryan Costello, who is not planning to seek re-election for his Pennsylvania seat, told CNN on Thursday that the ad and the overall tone Trump has struck on immigration \"doesn't make me happy.\" \"I can't imagine anybody in a close district wants the closing argument to be immigration,\" Costello said. \"Your local message is in competition with what the President is talking about.\" Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who's also not seeking re-election, called the video \"sickening.\" \"This is a sickening ad,\" tweeted Flake, who has been a regular Trump critic. \"Republicans everywhere should denounce it.\" The web video -- produced for the Trump campaign -- features Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican man who had been deported but returned to the United States and was convicted in February in the slaying of two California deputies. \"I'm going to kill more cops soon,\" a grinning Bracamontes is shown saying in court as captions flash across the screen reading, \"Democrats let him into our country. Democrats let him stay.\" The ad is a part of an ongoing effort by Republicans to make immigration their key issue before next week's election. In support of this effort, the President has constantly publicly denigrated a group of Central American migrants headed for the United States. On Monday, the Pentagon announced that it was sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border to stop the migrants. On Wednesday, Trump told reporters that up to 15,000 additional US troops could be sent there to deal with the group of approximately 3,500 migrants. Curbelo told Sciutto that such a move is \"clearly an overreaction.\" \"What we need is smart border security. And we need to invest more at the border with new technology, observation towers, drones, some physical barrier, for sure, and make that part of a compromise to provide a path to citizenship for Dreamers in our country,\" he said. Costello, who has also been critical of Trump in the past, told CNN that he doubts the President's focus on immigration will attract crucial swing voters next week. \"I don't think people are going to say that 'I need to go vote Republican because we need to stop those 5,000 Guatemalans from crossing the border in Texas,' \" Costello said, adding, \"Call me naive.\"",

      "text": "Halie Soifer serves as executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, an advocacy organization founded in 2017, which aims to help Democrats win control of the House, Senate and Oval Office in future elections by mobilizing the Jewish vote. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n(CNN) Words cannot express the horror, grief and outrage experienced by the Jewish community after the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue. As funerals began for the 11 lives tragically lost in what is believed to be the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history, President Trump insisted on visiting Pittsburgh against the wishes of local elected officials and many in the Jewish community.\nTrump's visit to the synagogue was unwelcome because of a stark and undeniable reality -- Donald Trump did not pull the trigger in Pittsburgh, but Donald Trump is to blame for helping spread the hate that fills the hearts of those who commit such egregious acts of violence. Halie Soifer Just look at the events of the past week. On Friday, we learned that Cesar Sayoc is accused of sending explosive devices to at least a dozen high-profile Democrats whom Trump had repeatedly vilified. The day after Sayoc was arrested, Robert Bowers was accused of initiating a killing spree at the synagogue in Pittsburgh. According to a criminal complaint, Bowers told authorities he wanted all Jews to die, and had posted on social media that the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society brings \"...invaders in that kill our people,\" referring to refugees. Bowers and Sayoc were both seemingly motivated by the culture of violence and hatred that Trump seems to thrive within and promote. Read More Less than 24 hours before the synagogue massacre, President Trump publicly repeated dog whistles used by anti-Semites. From the White House, Trump attacked \"globalists\" -- a classic anti-Semitic trope -- and laughed at the suggestion of jailing George Soros, a frequent Jewish target of Trump and anti-Semites. This came on the heels of Trump's declaration last week that he is a \"nationalist,\" which has been used in association with two infamous movements -- Nazism and white supremacy. To top it off, after indicating he was told to avoid such terminology, Trump defiantly instructed his supporters: \"Use that word. Use that word.\" Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke immediately took to Twitter to embrace Trump for defending the views of the KKK. The seeds of Pittsburgh were sown in Charlottesville Trump's rhetoric matters. He is the President of the United States and he has -- at best -- been grossly irresponsible and utterly reckless with his words. At worst, he has inspired violence targeting minority groups in a manner reminiscent of the darkest moments in history. Whether Donald Trump himself is an anti-Semite, racist, neo-Nazi or white supremacist is almost irrelevant. Those who align with these movements feel legitimized and emboldened by him. Even if Trump is willfully ignorant as to origins of his incendiary language, anti-Semites hear his message loud and clear, and believe he is their champion and ally. It is no coincidence that in 2017 anti-Semitic incidents in America surged nearly 60%, the largest single-year increase since the Anti-Defamation League began keeping records in 1979. Since his election, President Trump has stoked hatred of racial and religious minorities, cultivated fear of immigrants and refugees, and lied about alleged threats on our borders. He has been silent or equivocated in the face of blatant anti-Semitism, such as that witnessed by the neo-Nazis chanting \"Jews will not replace us\" in Charlottesville, Virginia. And he has repeated false conspiracy theories about immigrants and Jews that have exacerbated xenophobia. From his campaign to build a wall on the Mexican border, to his Muslim ban, to his most recent description of a caravan of asylum-seekers headed to the United States as a \"national emergency,\" Donald Trump has lit a match and fueled a fire of racism and anti-Semitism, exploiting fear for his own perceived political gain. JUST WATCHED Protesters denounce Trump's Pittsburgh visit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nProtesters denounce Trump's Pittsburgh visit 03:11 Trump is responsible for the consequences of his words, just as Republicans in Congress are responsible when they fail to speak out against them. The silence of most Republicans in the face of Trump's abhorrent behavior has been deafening, as they have abdicated their responsibility to put country above party. To make matters worse, some Republicans -- such as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy -- have started to mimic Trump's repugnant behavior. McCarthy tweeted, and later deleted, false allegations of well-known Jewish Democrats buying elections, as an unprecedented number of neo-Nazis and white supremacists are running for office this election cycle, all as Republicans. In the age of Trump, anti-Semites and racists see the Republican Party as their home. Any Republican who does not see that their party has been hijacked by anti-Semitism, racism, Islamophobia and hatred is blind to reality. Donald Trump is not up for re-election in 2018, but Republicans who have enabled his agenda are on the ballot, and in less than one week we go to the polls in one of the most important elections in history. Americans who are fed up with right-wing violence can reject hatred and bigotry by electing a Democratic majority. Democrats have been unequivocal in their condemnation of the events in Pittsburgh, and understand that Americans have an obligation to reverse the increasingly dangerous and divisive trajectory of our country.

Sign up for our new newsletter .\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\nMeaningful change can occur with congressional oversight of the President, but only if Democrats win on November 6. An overwhelming number of Jews understand this reality and will support Democrats in the midterm elections as a rejection of Trump's policies. In the meantime, we stand in solidarity with those who protested Trump's visit to Pittsburgh. We see this President for what he is and what he has created, and it's devastating.",

      "text": "(CNN) The Taliban have strengthened their grip in Afghanistan over the past three years, according to a new report released by the US government's own ombudsman of the war.\nIn its quarterly report for the US Congress, the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said, \"The Taliban now controls more territory than at any time since 2001.\" The Afghan government currently controls or influences only 55.5% of the country's districts, marking the lowest level recorded since SIGAR began tracking district control in November 2015. Translated into layman's terms, the report measures \"control\" -- in which one side runs an area -- and \"influence\" -- in which one side has the upper hand. In November 2015, the Afghan government controlled 72% of districts in the country, but now controls just 56% of them. Insurgent influence or control has risen to 12.5% of districts from just 7% and approximately a third of Afghanistan is a \"contested\" area. Read More Afghanistan: A bad year in America's longest war The official figures offer a glimpse into the Afghan army's loosening grip in the face of a determined, sustained Taliban insurgency and a bleak outlook for America's involvement in the war -- now in its 17th year. The war in Afghanistan is the only US foreign policy issue on which US President Donald Trump has delivered a lengthy personal delineation of policy and goals. In August 2017 he said : \"One way or another, these problems will be solved — I'm a problem solver — and, in the end, we will win.\" Yet the challenges have been clear for the new US commander in Afghanistan, special forces veteran Gen. Scott Miller. Earlier this month, the top police and intelligence chief of the southern region of Kandahar was shot dead meters away from him during a maximum-security meeting; the gunman also injured one of Miller's top officers. Civilian deaths at a record high As the Taliban continues to slightly increase its territorial impact, civilian deaths keep rising. An escalation in insurgent attacks and fighting between the Taliban and government forces has helped drive the number of civilian deaths this year to its highest point on record . A total of 1,692 civilians were killed by June 30, according to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). JUST WATCHED Deadliest recorded year for Afghan civilians Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nDeadliest recorded year for Afghan civilians 02:54 From January 1 to September 30, 313 civilians were killed and 335 injuries in US-backed air strikes alone -- a 39% increase from 2017, according to the report, citing UNAMA data. Resolute Support, the larger non-combat NATO-led training and advisory mission, said far fewer civilians had died from air strikes, reporting 102 civilian deaths from January to August 15, 2018. Losing strength The Afghan National Security Forces (ANDSF), who are tasked with defending the war-ravaged country from a continuing insurgency, have struggled to maintain personnel -- indicating that a multi-billion dollar training program funded by the US is failing. The ANDSF is short of roughly 40,000 personnel -- or 11% -- of its target strength of 352,000 personnel. No explanation was provided for the drop in those numbers, although the growth of the insurgency over the past few years will probably have led to the deaths of many police or army personnel, or contributed to the decision of others to leave the forces. The United States Department of Justice has also raised concerns about the Afghan attorney general's performance, citing corruption and \"unproductive, corrupt and patronage-laden\" practices. Earlier this month, Afghans rode a wave of hope that the notoriously corrupt and inefficient political system in Afghanistan could be overhauled as they cast their ballots in a vote that had already been delayed for three years because of security concerns. But the days leading up to the vote were marred with violence. 4 million vote in Afghanistan despite violence and technical glitches The Taliban claimed responsibility for the October 18 attack on the powerful police chief of Kandahar province, Gen. Abdul Raziq Achakzai. Hours after his death, they issued another statement warning Afghans not to participate in what they called \"an American project from start to finish.\" The Taliban message said the group intended to close all \"major and minor roads\" throughout the country and urged Afghans to stay indoors. \"We do not want to harm any common Afghan and therefore ask the public and especially city dwellers to refrain from participating or casting votes during elections,\" it said. A candidate for parliament in Helmand province, Abdul Jabar Qahraman, was killed with three others by a bomb in his campaign office days before the election. After casting his vote, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani thanked law enforcement, election officials and citizens who made the election possible \"despite the risks involved.\"",

      "title": "Mark Penn: Democrats don't understand this surprising secret of Trump's success",
      "text": "OPINION Published 1 day ago Mark Penn: Democrats don't understand this surprising secret of Trump's success By Mark Penn | Fox News close Video New poll shows voters align more with Trump than GOP\nThere is no question that President Trump is the most disruptive force in politics today.\nThe president has torn up every political playbook. His political survival after two years in office is a modern-day miracle, and his polling numbers are even running ahead of where Presidents Obama and Clinton were at this point.\nPresident Trump’s most powerful weapon so far has not been the insult – which he certainly has been willing to use – but the idea.\nTake his idea for ending birthright citizenship. Can’t say I support it. I don’t. But it’s not an insult, a racial epithet, or an off-color joke. It’s an idea that focuses on how an open-borders policy reverberates. And it’s even an idea that former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada once passionately supported.\nAnother Trump idea on immigration is his support for creating a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children under the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program, in return for three things: a wall on our border with Mexico; an end to the immigration lottery; and a curtailing of chain migration (also known as family reunification) that enables immigrants to bring family members to the U.S.\nAsk virtually any voter out there and he or she will tell you the President Trump wants to curtail immigration and secure our borders. It’s about as clear an issue position as anyone can imagine. He has made issues vs. insults a false choice and has done both.\nWhile Americans strongly oppose splitting up families at the border, in polls they have consistently given majority support to the president’s overall position to restore border security.\nNow hitting the stump against Trump and Republicans running in Tuesday’s midterm elections are former President Obama and former presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\nThe Sanders critique is simple and direct – he has labeled Trump the most racist, sexist (and four other adjectives) president in history.\nObama, breaking longstanding post-presidential tradition, attacked Trump as “a shameless liar.”\nOther than investigations and impeachment, what are the Democrats running on?\nThe adjectives against Trump fly in the mainstream media, with “racist” hard to miss as a descriptor for all things Trump.\nNow, Trump is no saint here. He has hurled more than his fair share of insults, especially in response to attacks on him. And he has paid a heavy price in opinion polls as a result of his willingness to use insults when voters are asked to evaluate his personality.\nYet Trump has also deployed more specific issue ideas than anyone in a long time.\nPeople know the president said he would move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem – and he did.\nPresident Trump said would replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico – and he did.\nTrump stands for lower taxes, stronger law enforcement, cutting government regulation and eliminating red tape.\nThe president thinks the Federal Reserve shouldn’t raise interest rates as fast as it is or it will cause a recession.\nIf you think about it, you probably know President Trump’s positions on almost every major issue. And obviously, he has doubled down on immigration as the make-or-break issue for him and his party.\nWhat exactly does Barack Obama stand for? Bernie Sanders at least has free college as an idea you can remember, albeit vague.\nWhat about House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.?\nOther than investigations and impeachment, what are the Democrats running on? They have made an issue of health insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions. Trump has said he too would cover them. The Democratic idea is not a health-care plan, but an attack.\nNor do Democrats have an economic plan many people can remember. Nor a plan on immigration. Nor a plan to deal with jobs migrating to China and Mexico.\nPresident Trump taunts the Democrats, calling them the “open borders” party. And yet the Democrats have absolutely no plan for dealing with illegal immigration. In response, they attack the president personally – exactly how Hillary Clinton handled Trump in the last presidential campaign.\nIt looks like the Democrats will likely win majority control of the House in the midterm elections. So the battle of insults vs. issues may be moot in today’s rough-and-tumble politics. But if the Republicans win more seats in the Senate, that will be a victory compared to what happened in 1994 or 2010.\nAs surprising as it was in 2016, there’s only one candidate really running on detailed issue positions – and he is not even on the ballot this year.\nGiven how the presidential election turned out, it’s all the more surprising that the Democrats would again leave themselves open on the ideas front. Voters want progress, not just partisanship.\nMark Penn is managing director of the Stagwell Group.

      "text": "Michael D'Antonio and Peter Eisner are the authors of the new book, \" The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n(CNN) With the midterm election almost here and President Donald Trump piling one outrageous act on another, controversies that might otherwise blaze for days are being forgotten. One that should remain in our minds is the appearance of a make-believe rabbi at a campaign event Mike Pence headlined in Michigan. It was, in the words of a real rabbi , Jason Miller, \"an insulting political stunt.\" That it occurred days after an anti-Semite allegedly killed 11 worshipers at a synagogue made it far worse.\nMichael D'Antonio Peter Eisner At the rally, the vice president announced that he was \"privileged to be joined today by a leader in the Jewish Community here in Michigan.\" The \"rabbi,\" Loren Jacobs, donned a Jewish prayer shawl and invoked Jesus, with a reference to his Hebrew name -- Yeshua. As if this signal wasn't enough, he noted that Yeshua is \" Jesus the messiah ,\" but failed to mention the 11 victims of the massacre by name. With little effort, anyone can go to the Internet and discover that Jacobs is not a rabbi but an evangelical Christian whose main religious education was obtained at the Moody Bible Institute, a Christian school that trains people to spread the faith around the world. However, as an evangelical Christian well-versed in the culture of his faith, Pence would not have needed to do any research. All he had to do was listen to Jacobs in order to grasp what was going on. Pence surely knew that a \"rabbi\" who worships Jesus as the messiah is actually impersonating a rabbi, and that, when Jacobs took the stage and began speaking at the rally, he was offending many Jewish Americans . Pence aides deflected responsibility for this by noting that a local Jewish politician, Lena Epstein, had actually invited Jacobs to participate. But on a night so close to the tragedy in Pittsburgh, at the very least, Pence would have earned high marks by saying a corrective word. He did not. Read More 11 people were gunned down at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Here are their stories Real Jewish leaders were outraged by Pence's legitimization of Jacobs, who calls himself a Messianic (or Christian) Jew and who believes that real Jews, who don't accept Christ, are doomed to hell . Among devoted conservative Christians like Pence, so-called Messianic Jews are valued as evangelists for Jesus whose special interest lies in converting Jewish people to Christianity. This mission fulfills the New Testament's command that believers convert the people of the world to save souls from the eternal agony. Evangelists like Jacobs are extreme in their methods and many regard them as manipulative at best and deceptive at worst. However they are not alone when it comes to using questionable methods to bring their religious message to Jews. Mourners walk behind the hearse carrying the casket of Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz following a funeral service at the Jewish Community Center in the Squirrel Hill section of Pittsburgh, Tuesday Oct. 30, 2018. Rabinowitz was one of 11 people killed while worshipping at the Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday Oct. 27, 2018. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) Earlier this year Pence himself used the occasion of a speech at the Israeli Knesset to mix Christianity with Judaism in a way that was controversial to say the least. While quoting the Bible, he replaced the very Jewish concept of \"good works\" in the world with the word \"faith.\" It is a key distinction: Jewish thought views religion as requiring positive action in the world—faith alone, without observing Biblical commandments, is not enough; \"faith,\" in the view of Pence and other right-wing Christian evangelicals, is an end unto itself. This deviation put Pence's speech in a Christian context few noticed. One who did was Amit Gvaryahu, a Bible scholar at Hebrew University, who wrote in the Israeli paper Haaretz ; \"It takes a special kind of chutzpah to stand in front of a Jewish audience and explain their own tradition to them using language and texts that historically have rendered actual Jews pathologically redundant to the world, and still today cast us as a tool.\" For more opinion...

It's possible he did not know about Jacobs--and merely stood by as this fake rabbi prayed to \"God and father of my lord and savior Yeshua, Jesus the Messiah.\" But if he did know what Jacobs was about, then this would surely represent Pence's version of a dog whistle—one that he may have believed only conservative Christians could notice. He was wrong.",
